<Les Miserables悲惨世界>


 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 1 M. Myriel

    In 1815, M. Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D--He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see of D---- since 1806.</P>

    Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.</P>

    The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.</P>

    In 1804, M. Myriel was the Cure of B-- [Brignolles]. He was already advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.</P>

    About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his curacy--just what, is not precisely known--took him to Paris. Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch.One day, when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Cure, who was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and said abruptly:--</P>

    "Who is this good man who is staring at me?"</P>

    "Sire," said M. Myriel, "you are looking at a good man, and I at a great man. Each of us can profit by it."</P>

    That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure, and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed Bishop of D----</P>

    What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of M. Myriel's life? No one knew.</P>

    Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.</P>

    M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think.</P>

    He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than words-- palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.</P>

    However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one would have dared to recall them.</P>

    M. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.</P>

    Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been the servant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.</P>

    Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she realized the ideal expressed by the word "respectable"; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable.She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen.</P>

    She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;-- a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.</P>

    Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of her activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.</P>

    On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.</P>

    The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.</P>

    一八一五年，迪涅①的主教是查理·佛朗沙·卞福汝·米里哀先生。他是个七十五岁左右的老人；从一八○六年起，他已就任迪涅区主教的职位。</P>

    虽然这些小事绝不触及我们将要叙述的故事的本题，但为了全面精确起见，在此地提一提在他就任之初，人们所传播的有关他的一些风闻与传说也并不是无用的。大众关于某些人的传说，无论是真是假，在他们的生活中，尤其是在他们的命运中所占的地位，往往和他们亲身所作的事是同等重要的。米里哀先生是艾克斯法院的一个参议的儿子，所谓的司法界的贵族。据说他的父亲因为要他继承②那职位，很早，十八岁或二十岁，就按照司法界贵族家庭间相当普遍的习惯，为他完了婚。米里哀先生虽已结婚，据说仍常常惹起别人的谈论。他品貌不凡，虽然身材颇小，但是生得俊秀，风度翩翩，谈吐隽逸；他一生的最初阶段完全消磨在交际场所和与妇女们的厮混中。革命③爆发了，事变叠出，司法界贵族家庭因受到摧毁，驱逐，追捕而东奔西散了。米里哀先生，当革命刚开始时便出亡到意大利。他的妻，因早已害肺病，死了。他们一个孩子也没有。此后，他的一生有些什么遭遇呢？法国旧社会的崩溃，他自己家庭的破落，一般流亡者可能因远道传闻和恐怖的夸大而显得更加可怕的九三年①的种种悲剧，是否使他在思想上产生过消沉和孤独的意念呢？一个人在生活上或财产上遭了大难还可能不为所动，但有时有一种神秘可怕的打击，打在人的心上，却能使人一蹶不振；一向在欢乐和温情中度日的他，是否受过那种突如其来的打击呢？没有谁那样说，我们所知道的只是：他从意大利回来，就已经当了教士了。</P>

    ①迪涅（Digne）在法国南部，是下阿尔卑斯省的省会。</P>

    ②当时法院的官职是可以买的，并可传给儿孙。</P>

    ③指一七八九年法国资产阶级革命。</P>

    ①一七九三年是革命达到高潮的一年。</P>

    一八○四年，米里哀先生是白里尼奥尔的本堂神甫。他当时已经老了，过着深居简出的生活。</P>

    接近加冕②时，他为了本区的一件不知道什么小事，到巴黎去过一趟。他代表他教区的信众们向上级有所陈请，曾夹在一群显要人物中去见过费什红衣主教。一天，皇帝来看他的舅父③，这位尊贵的本堂神甫正在前厅候见，皇上也恰巧走过。拿破仑看见这位老人用双好奇的眼睛瞧着他，便转过身来，突然问道：</P>

    “瞧着我的那汉子是谁呀？”</P>

    “陛下，”米里哀先生说，“您瞧一个汉子，我瞧一个天子。</P>

    彼此都还上算。” </P>

    ②拿破仑于一八○四年三月十八日称帝，十二月二日加冕。</P>

    ③指费什。</P>

    皇帝在当天晚上向红衣主教问明了这位本堂神甫的姓名。不久以后，米里哀先生极其诧异地得到被任为迪涅主教的消息。</P>

    此外，人们对米里哀先生初期生活所传述的轶事，哪些是真实的？谁也不知道。很少人知道米里哀这家人在革命以前的情况。</P>

    任何人初到一个说话的嘴多而思考的头脑少的小城里总有够他受的，米里哀先生所受的也不例外。尽管他是主教，并且正因为他是主教，他就得受。总之，牵涉到他名字的那些谈话，也许只是一些闲谈而已，内容不过是听来的三言两语和捕风捉影的东西，有时甚至连捕风捉影也说不上，照南方人那种强烈的话来说，只是“胡诌”而已。</P>

    不管怎样，他住在迪涅担任教职九年以后，当初成为那些小城市和小人们谈话的题材的闲话，都完全被丢在脑后了。没有谁再敢提到，甚至没有谁再敢回想那些闲话了。</P>

    米里哀先生到迪涅时有个老姑娘伴着他，这老姑娘便是比他小十岁的妹子巴狄斯丁姑娘。</P>

    他们的佣人只是一个和巴狄斯丁姑娘同年的女仆，名叫马格洛大娘，现在，她在做了“司铎先生的女仆”后，取得了这样一个双重头衔：姑娘的女仆和主教的管家。</P>

    巴狄斯丁姑娘是个身材瘦长、面貌清癯、性情温厚的人儿，她体现了“可敬”两个字所表达的理想，因为一个妇人如果要达到“可敬”的地步，似乎总得先做母亲。她从不曾有过美丽的时期，她的一生只是一连串圣洁的工作，这就使她的身体呈现白色和光彩；将近老年时，她具有我们所谓的那种“慈祥之美”。她青年时期的消瘦到她半老时，转成了一种清虚疏朗的神韵，令人想见她是一个天使。她简直是个神人，处女当之也有逊色。她的身躯，好象是阴影构成的，几乎没有足以显示性别的实体，只是一小撮透着微光的物质，秀长的眼睛老低垂着，我们可以说她是寄存在人间的天女。</P>

    马格洛大娘是个矮老、白胖、臃肿、忙碌不定、终日气喘吁吁的妇人，一则因为她操作勤劳，再则因为她有气喘病。</P>

    米里哀先生到任以后，人们就照将主教列在仅次于元帅地位的律令所规定的仪节，把他安顿在主教院里。市长和议长向他作了初次的拜访，而他，在他那一面，也向将军和省长作了初次的拜访。</P>

    部署既毕，全城静候主教执行任务。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 2 M. Myriel becomes M. Welcome

    The episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital. </P>

    The episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in 1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. </P>

    Everything about it had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with magnificent trees. </P>

    In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand Prior of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. </P>

    The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble. </P>

    The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a small garden. </P>

    Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. </P>

    The visit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house. </P>

    "Monsieur the director of the hospital," said he to him, "how many sick people have you at the present moment?" </P>

    "Twenty-six, Monseigneur." </P>

    "That was the number which I counted," said the Bishop. </P>

    "The beds," pursued the director, "are very much crowded against each other." </P>

    "That is what I observed." </P>

    "The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them." </P>

    "So it seems to me." </P>

    "And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the convalescents." </P>

    "That was what I said to myself." </P>

    "In case of epidemics,--we have had the typhus fever this year; we had the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at times,--we know not what to do." </P>

    "That is the thought which occurred to me." </P>

    "What would you have, Monseigneur?" said the director. "One must resign one's self." </P>

    This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground-floor. </P>

    The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital. </P>

    "Monsieur," said he, "how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold?" </P>

    "Monseigneur's dining-room?" exclaimed the stupefied director. </P>

    The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes. </P>

    "It would hold full twenty beds," said he, as though speaking to himself. Then, raising his voice:-- </P>

    "Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something. </P>

    There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of you, in five or six small rooms. There are three of us here, and we have room for sixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours. Give me back my house; you are at home here." </P>

    On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the Bishop's palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital. </P>

    M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the Revolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage. M. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own hand:-- </P>

    NOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES. </P>

    For the little seminary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,500 livres </P>

    Society of the mission . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100 " </P>

    ------ </P>

    Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,000 " </P>

    M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of D---- As has been seen, he called it regulating his household expenses. </P>

    This arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle Baptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D----as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and venerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her adherence. Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. It will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted. </P>

    And when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine. </P>

    One day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop said:-- </P>

    "And still I am quite cramped with it all!" </P>

    "I should think so!" exclaimed Madame Magloire. "Monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese. It was customary for bishops in former days." "Hold!" cried the Bishop, "you are quite right, Madame Magloire." </P>

    And he made his demand. </P>

    Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand under consideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, under this heading: Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits. </P>

    This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M. Bigot de Preameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and confidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic lines:-- "Expenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the use of these trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. No one travels otherwise than on horseback. Even the bridge between Durance and Chateau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus, greedy and avaricious. This man played the good priest when he first came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden days. Oh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte, until the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Down with the Pope! [Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am for Caesar alone." Etc., etc. </P>

    On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame Magloire. "Good," said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; "Monseigneur began with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after all. He has regulated all his charities. Now here are three thousand francs for us! At last!" </P>

    That same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms:-- </P>

    EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT. </P>

    For furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres </P>

    For the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . . 250 " </P>

    For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan . . . 250 " </P>

    For foundlings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 " </P>

    For orphans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 " </P>

    ----- </P>

    Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000 " </P>

    Such was M. Myriel's budget. </P>

    As for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans, dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or chapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy. </P>

    After a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those who lacked knocked at M. Myriel's door,--the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress. Considerable sums of money passed through his hands, but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities. </P>

    Far from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was received. It was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he received, he never had any. Then he stripped himself. </P>

    The usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of the country-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct, among the names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning for them; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu [Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him. Moreover, this appellation pleased him. </P>

    "I like that name," said he. "Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur." </P>

    We do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.</P>

    迪涅的主教院是和医院毗连的。</P>

    主教院是座广阔壮丽、石料建成的大厦，是巴黎大学神学博士，西摩尔修院院长，一七一二年的迪涅主教亨利·彼惹在前世纪初兴建的。那确是一座华贵的府第。其中一切都具有豪华的气派，主教的私邸，大小客厅，各种房间，相当宽敞的院子，具有佛罗伦萨古代风格的穹窿的回廊，树木苍翠的园子。楼下朝花园的一面，有间富丽堂皇的游廊式的长厅，一七一四年七月二十九日，主教亨利·彼惹曾在那餐厅里公宴过这些要人：</P>

    昂布伦亲王棗大主教查理·勃吕拉·德·让利斯；</P>

    嘉布遣会修士棗格拉斯主教安东尼·德·梅吉尼；</P>

    法兰西祈祷大师棗雷兰群岛圣奥诺雷修院院长菲力浦·德·旺多姆；</P>

    梵斯男爵棗主教佛朗沙·德·白东·德·格利翁；</P>

    格朗代夫贵人棗主教凯撒·德·沙白朗·德·福高尔吉尔；</P>

    经堂神甫棗御前普通宣道士棗塞内士贵人棗主教让·沙阿兰。</P>

    这七个德高望重的人物的画像一直点缀着那间长厅，“一七一四年七月二十九日”这个值得纪念的日子，也用金字刻在厅里的一张白大理石碑上。</P>

    那医院却是一所狭隘低陋的房子，只有一层楼，带个小小花园。</P>

    主教到任三天以后参观了医院。参观完毕，他恭请那位院长到他家里去。</P>

    “院长先生，”他说，“您现在有多少病人？”</P>

    “二十六个，我的主教。”</P>

    “正和我数过的一样。”主教说。</P>

    “那些病床，”院长又说，“彼此靠得太近了，一张挤着一张的。”</P>

    “那正是我注意到的。”</P>

    “那些病房都只是一些小间，里面的空气很难流通。”</P>

    “那正是我感觉到的。”</P>

    “并且，即使是在有一线阳光的时候，那园子对刚刚起床的病人们也是很小的。”</P>

    “那正是我所见到的。”</P>

    “传染病方面，今年我们有过伤寒，两年前，有过疹子，有时多到百来个病人，我们真不知道怎么办。”</P>

    “那正是我所想到的。”</P>

    “有什么办法呢，我的主教？”院长说，“我们总得将就些。”</P>

    那次谈话正是在楼下那间游廊式的餐厅里进行的。</P>

    主教沉默了一会，突然转向院长。</P>

    “先生，”他说，“您以为，就拿这个厅来说，可以容纳多少床位？”</P>

    “主教的餐厅！”惊惶失措的院长喊了起来。</P>

    主教把那间厅周围望了一遍，象是在用眼睛测算。</P>

    “此地足够容纳二十张病床！”他自言自语地说，随着又提高嗓子，“瞧，院长先生，我告诉您，这里显然有了错误。你们二十六个人住在五六间小屋子里，而我们这儿三个人，却有六十个人的地方。这里有了错误，我告诉您。您来住我的房子，我去住您的。您把我的房子还我。这儿是您的家。”</P>

    第二天，那二十六个穷人便安居在主教的府上，主教却住在医院里。</P>

    米里哀先生绝没有财产，因为他的家已在革命时期破落了。他的妹子每年领着五百法郎的养老金，正够她个人住在神甫家里的费用。米里哀先生以主教身份从政府领得一万五千法郎的薪俸。在他搬到医院的房子里去住的那天，米里哀先生就一次作出决定，把那笔款分作以下各项用途。我们把他亲手写的一张单子抄在下面。</P>

    我的家用分配单</P>

    教士培养所津贴一千五百利弗①</P>

    传教会津贴一百利弗</P>

    孟迪第圣辣匝禄会修士们津贴一百利弗</P>

    巴黎外方传教会津贴二百利弗</P>

    圣灵会津贴一百五十利弗</P>

    圣地宗教团体津贴一百利弗</P>

    各慈幼会津贴三百利弗</P>

    阿尔勒慈幼会补助费五十利弗</P>

    改善监狱用费四百利弗</P>

    囚犯抚慰及救济事业费五百利弗</P>

    赎免因债入狱的家长费一千利弗</P>

    补助本教区学校贫寒教师津贴二千利弗</P>

    捐助上阿尔卑斯省义仓一百利弗</P>

    迪涅，玛诺斯克，锡斯特龙等地妇女联合会，</P>

    贫寒女孩的义务教育费一千五百利弗</P>

    穷人救济费六千利弗</P>

    本人用费一千利弗</P>

    共计　一万五千利弗 </P>

    ①利弗（livre）当时的一种币制，等于一法郎。</P>

    米里哀先生在他当迪涅主教的任期中，几乎没有改变过这个分配办法。我们知道，他把这称作“分配了他的家用”。</P>

    那种分配是被巴狄斯丁姑娘以绝对服从的态度接受了的。米里哀先生对那位圣女来说，是她的阿哥，同时也是她的主教，是人世间的朋友和宗教中的上司。她爱他，并且极其单纯地敬服他。当他说话时，她俯首恭听；当他行动时，她追随伺候。只有那位女仆马格洛大娘，稍微有些噜苏。我们已经知道，主教只为自己留下一千利弗，和巴狄斯丁姑娘的养老金合并起来，每年才一千五百法郎。两个老妇人和老头儿都在那一千五百法郎里过活。</P>

    当镇上有教士来到迪涅时，主教先生还有办法招待他们。</P>

    那是由于马格洛大娘的极其节俭和巴狄斯丁姑娘的精打细算。</P>

    一天棗到迪涅约三个月时，主教说：</P>

    “这样下去，我真有些维持不了！”</P>

    “当然罗！”马格洛大娘说。“主教大人连省里应给的那笔城区车马费和教区巡视费都没有要来。对从前的那几位主教，原是照例有的。”</P>

    “对！”主教说。“您说得对，马格洛大娘。”</P>

    他提出了申请。</P>

    过了些时候，省务委员会审查了那申请，通过每年给他一笔三千法郎的款子，名义是“主教先生的轿车、邮车和教务巡视津贴”。</P>

    这件事使当地的士绅们大嚷起来。有一个帝国元老院①的元老，他从前当过五百人院②的元老，曾经赞助雾月十八日政变①，住在迪涅城附近一座富丽堂皇的元老宅第里，为这件事，他写了一封怨气冲天的密函给宗教大臣皮戈·德·普雷阿麦内先生。我们现在把它的原文节录下来：</P>

    “轿车津贴？在一个人口不到四千的城里，有什么用处？邮车和巡视津贴？首先要问这种巡视有什么好处，其次，在这样的山区，怎样走邮车？路都没有。只能骑着马走。从迪朗斯到阿尔努堡的那座桥也只能够走小牛车。所有的神甫全一样，又贪又吝。这一个在到任之初，还象个善良的宗徒。现在却和其他人一样了，他非坐轿车和邮车不行了，他非享受从前那些主教所享受的奢侈品不可了。咳！这些臭神甫！伯爵先生，如果皇上不替我们肃清这些吃教的坏蛋，一切事都好不了。打倒教皇！（当时正和罗马②发生磨擦。）至于我，我只拥护恺撒……” </P>

    ①指拿破仑帝国的元老院，由二十四人组成，任期是终身的。</P>

    ②一七九五年十月，代表新兴资产阶级的热月党，根据自己制定的新宪法，由有产者投票选举，成立了元老院（上院）和五百人院（下院）。</P>

    ①法兰西共和国八年雾月十八日（一七九九年十一月九日），拿破仑发动政变，开始了独裁统治。</P>

    ②教皇庇护七世于一八○四年到巴黎为拿破仑加冕，后被拘禁在法国，直到拿破仑失败。</P>

    在另一方面，这件事却使马格洛大娘大为高兴。</P>

    “好了！”她对巴狄斯丁姑娘说。“主教在开始时只顾别人，但结果也非顾自己不可了。他已把他的慈善捐分配停当，这三千法郎总算是我们的了。”</P>

    当天晚上，主教写了这样一张单子交给他的妹子。</P>

    车马费及巡视津贴</P>

    供给住院病人肉汤的津贴一千五百利弗</P>

    艾克斯慈幼会的津贴二百五十利弗</P>

    德拉吉尼昂慈幼会的津贴二百五十利弗</P>

    救济被遗弃的孩子五百利弗</P>

    救济孤儿五百利弗</P>

    共计三千利弗</P>

    以上就是米里哀先生的预算表。</P>

    至于主教的额外开支，以及请求提早婚礼费、特许开斋费、婴孩死前洗礼费、宣教费、为教堂或私立小堂祝圣费、行结婚典礼费等等，这位主教都到有钱人身上去取来给穷人；取得紧也给得急。</P>

    没有多久，各方捐赠的钱财源源而来。富有的和贫乏的人都来敲米里哀先生的门，后者来请求前者所留下的捐赠。不到一年功夫，主教便成了一切慈善捐的保管人和苦难的援助者。大笔大笔的款项都经过他的手，但没有任何东西能稍稍改变他的生活方式，或使他在他所必需的用品以外增添一点多余的东西。</P>

    不但如此，由于社会上层的博爱总敌不过下层的穷苦，我们可以说，所有的钱都早已在收入以前付出了，正好象旱地上的水一样；他白白地收进一些钱，却永远没有余款；于是他从自己身上搜刮起来。</P>

    主教们照例把自己的教名全部写在他们的布告和公函头上。当地的穷人，由于一种本能的爱戴，在这位主教的几个名字中，挑选了对他们具有意义的一个，称他为卞福汝①主教。我们也将随时照样用那名字称呼他。并且这个称呼很中他的意。 </P>

    ①卞福汝（Bienvenu）是“欢迎”的意思。</P>

    “我喜欢这名称，”他说，“卞福汝赛过主教大人。”</P>

    我们并不认为在此地所刻画的形象是逼真的，我们只说它近似而已。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 3 A Hard Bishopric for a Good Bishop

    The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms. The diocese of D---- is a fatiguing one. There are very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite a task. </P>

    The Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in the neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on a donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard for them, he went alone. </P>

    One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was mounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not permit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass, with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around him. "Monsieur the Mayor," said the Bishop, "and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from necessity, I assure you, and not from vanity." </P>

    In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked rather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and his examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to the poor, he said: "Look at the people of Briancon! They have conferred on the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which is blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a single murderer among them." </P>

    In villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: "Look at the people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family has his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service in the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all the inhabitants of the village--men, women, and children--go to the poor man's field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and his grain to his granary." To families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said: "Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years. Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may find husbands." To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: "Look at those good peasants in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand souls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge nor bailiff is known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the imposts, taxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels for nothing, divides inheritances without charge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he is a just man among simple men." To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more the people of Queyras: "Do you know how they manage?" he said. "Since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher, they have school-masters who are paid by the whole valley, who make the round of the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days in that, and instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen them there. They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach reading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens. But what a disgrace to be ignorant! Do like the people of Queyras!" </P>

    Thus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he invented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and many images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus Christ. And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.</P>

    主教先生并不因为他的马车变成了救济款而减少他的巡回视察工作。迪涅教区是个苦地方。平原少，山地多，我们刚才已经提到。三十二个司铎区，四十一个监牧区，二百八十五个分区。巡视那一切，确成问题，这位主教先生却能完成任务。如果是在附近，他就步行；在平原，坐小马车；在山里，就乘骡兜。那两个高年的妇人还陪伴着他。如果路程对她们太辛苦，他便一个人去。</P>

    一天，他骑着一头毛驴，走到塞内士，那是座古老的主教城。当时他正囊空如洗，不可能有别种坐骑。地方长官来到主教公馆门口迎接他，瞧见他从驴背上下来，觉得有失体统。另外几个士绅也围着他笑。</P>

    “长官先生和各位先生，”主教说，“我知道什么事使你们感到丢人，你们一定认为一个贫苦的牧师跨着耶稣基督的坐</P>

    骑未免妄自尊大。我是不得已才这样做的，老实说，并非出自虚荣。”</P>

    在巡视工作中，他是谦虚和蔼的，闲谈的时间多，说教的时候少。他素来不把品德问题提到高不可攀的地步，也从不向远处去找他的论据和范例。对某一乡的居民，他常叙说邻乡的榜样。在那些对待穷人刻薄的镇上，他说：“你们瞧瞧布里昂松地方的人吧。他们给了穷人、寡妇和孤儿一种特权，使他们可以比旁人早三天割他们草场上的草料。如果他们的房屋要坍了，就会有人替他们重盖，不要工资。这也可算得上是上帝庇佑的地方了。在整整一百年中，从没一个人犯过凶杀案。”</P>

    在那些斤斤计较利润和收获物的村子里，他说：“你们瞧瞧昂布伦地方的人吧。万一有个家长在收割时，因儿子都在服兵役，女孩也在城里工作，而自己又害病不能劳动，本堂神甫就把他的情形在宣道时提出来，等到礼拜日，公祷完毕，村里所有的人，男的，女的，孩子们都到那感到困难的人的田里去替他收割，并且替他把麦秸和麦粒搬进仓去。”对那些因银钱和遗产问题而分裂的家庭，他说：“你们瞧瞧德福宜山区的人吧。那是一片非常荒凉的地方，五十年也听不到一次黄莺的歌声。可是，当有一家的父亲死了，他的儿子便各自出外谋生，把家产留给姑娘们，好让她们找得到丈夫。”在那些争讼成风，农民每因告状而倾家荡产的镇上，他说：“你们看看格拉谷的那些善良的老乡吧。那里有三千人口。我的上帝！那真象一个小小的共和国。他们既不知道有审判官，也不知道有执法官。处理一切的是乡长。他分配捐税，凭良心向各人抽捐，义务地排解纠纷，替人分配遗产，不取酬金，判处案情，不收讼费；大家也都服他，因为他是那些简朴的人中一个正直的人。”在那些没有教师的村子里，他又谈到格拉谷的居民了：“你们知道他们怎么办？”他说，“一个只有十家到十五家人口的小地方，自然不能经常供养一个乡村教师，于是他们全谷公聘几个教师，在各村巡回教学，在这村停留八天，那村停留十天。那些教师常到市集上去，我常在那些地方遇见他们。我们只须看插在帽带上的鹅毛笔，就可以认出他们来。那些只教人读书的带一管笔，教人读又教人算的带两管，教人读算和拉丁文的带三管。他们都是很有学问的人。做一个无知无识的人多么可羞！</P>

    你们向格拉谷的居民学习吧。”</P>

    他那样谈着，严肃地，象父兄那样；在缺少实例的时候，他就创造一些言近而意远的话，用简括的词句和丰富的想象，直达他的目的；那正是耶稣基督的辩才，能自信，又能服人。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 4 Works corresponding to Words

    His conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from his arm-chair, and went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the upper shelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not reach it. "Madame Magloire," said he, "fetch me a chair. My greatness [grandeur] does not reach as far as that shelf." </P>

    One of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lo, rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she designated as "the expectations" of her three sons. She had numerous relatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons were the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. On one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these "expectations." She interrupted herself impatiently: "Mon Dieu, cousin! What are you thinking about?" "I am thinking," replied the Bishop, "of a singular remark, which is to be found, I believe, in St. Augustine,-`Place your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit.'" </P>

    At another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the dead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives, spread over an entire page: "What a stout back Death has!" he exclaimed. "What a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity!" </P>

    He was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always concealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful vicar came to D----, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he represented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M. Geborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M. Geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, "There is M. Geborand purchasing paradise for a sou." </P>

    When it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy and avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time, an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has actually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, "You must give me something, M. le Marquis." The Marquis turned round and answered dryly, "I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur." "Give them to me," replied the Bishop. </P>

    One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:-- </P>

    "My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants' dwellings in France which have but three openings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just put poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings, and behold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to men; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God. In the department of the Isere, in the Var, in the two departments of the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even wheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they have no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in pitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of Dauphine. They make bread for six months at one time; they bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread up with an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to render it eatable. My brethren, have pity! Behold the suffering on all sides of you!" </P>

    Born a Provencal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south. He said, "En be! moussu, ses sage?" as in lower Languedoc; "Onte anaras passa?" as in the Basses-Alpes; "Puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase," as in upper Dauphine. This pleased the people extremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts. </P>

    Moreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account. He said, "Examine the road over which the fault has passed." </P>

    Being, as he described himself with a smile, an ex-sinner, he had none of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal of distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a doctrine which may be summed up as follows:-- </P>

    "Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his temptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it, cheek it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may be some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is venial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer. </P>

    "To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err, fall, sin if you will, but be upright. </P>

    "The least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dream of the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a gravitation." </P>

    When he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very quickly, "Oh! oh!" he said, with a smile; "to all appearance, this is a great crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisies which have taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter." </P>

    He was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of human society rest. He said, "The faults of women, of children, of the feeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands, the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise." </P>

    He said, moreover, "Teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction gratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul is full of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the shadow." </P>

    It will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel. </P>

    One day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the point of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for a woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was held, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone could accuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they insisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all. The man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. </P>

    By bringing jealousy into play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had educed the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this in silence. When they had finished, he inquired,-- </P>

    "Where are this man and woman to be tried?" </P>

    "At the Court of Assizes." </P>

    He went on, "And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?" </P>

    A tragic event occurred at D---- A man was condemned to death for murder. He was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public. The town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell ill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments. They sent for the cure. It seems that he refused to come, saying, "That is no affair of mine. I have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, and with that mountebank: I, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my place." This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, "Monsieur le Cure is right: it is not his place; it is mine." </P>

    He went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the "mountebank," called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the condemned man for his own. He told him the best truths, which are also the most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to bless. He taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man was on the point of dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His condemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery of things, and which we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness. The Bishop made him see light. </P>

    On the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the Bishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords. </P>

    He mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The sufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was radiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God. The Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall, he said to him: "God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray, believe, enter into life: the Father is there." When he descended from the scaffold, there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass. They did not know which was most worthy of admiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble dwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as his palace, he said to his sister, "I have just officiated pontifically." </P>

    Since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on this conduct of the Bishop, "It is affectation." </P>

    This, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms. The populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and admired him. </P>

    As for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine, and it was a long time before he recovered from it. </P>

    In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has something about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision. The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, iron and cords. </P>

    It seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre initiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter's work saw, that this machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood, this iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on. The scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted. </P>

    Therefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day following the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him. He, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved: "I did not think that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs to God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?" </P>

    In course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished. Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution. </P>

    M. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying. He did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor. Widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him; he came of his own accord. He understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love, of the mother who had lost her child. As he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable consoler! He sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to magnify and dignify it by hope. He said:-- </P>

    "Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think not of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the living light of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven." He knew that faith is wholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, by pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star.</P>

    他的谈话是随和而愉快的。他总要求自己适合那两个伴他过活的老妇人的知识水平。当他笑起来，那确是小学生的笑。</P>

    马格洛大娘诚心诚意地称他做“大人”。一天，他从他的围椅里站起来走向书橱，要去取一本书。那本书正在顶上的那一格。主教的身材矮小，达不到。</P>

    “马格洛大娘，”他说，“请您搬张椅子给我。本大人还‘大’不到那块木板呢。”</P>

    他的一个远亲，德·洛伯爵夫人，一有机会，总爱在他跟前数她三个儿子的所谓“希望”。她有几个年纪很老行将就木的长辈，她那几个孩子自然是他们的继承人了。三个中最年幼的一个将从一个姑祖母那里获得一笔整整十万利弗的年金，第二个承继他叔父的公爵头衔，长子应承袭他祖先的世卿爵位。主教平日常听这位做母亲的那些天真可恕的夸耀，从不开口。但有一次，当德·洛夫人又唠唠叨叨提到所有那些承继和“希望”时，他仿佛显得比平日更出神一些。她不耐烦地改变自己的话题说：“我的上帝，我的表哥！您到底在想什么？”“我在想，”主教说，“一句怪话，大概出自圣奥古斯丁：‘把你们的希望寄托在那个无可承继者的身上吧。’”</P>

    另一次，他接到本乡一个贵人的讣告，一大张纸上所铺排的，除了亡人的各种荣衔以外，还把他所有一切亲属的各种封建的和贵族的尊称全列了上去。他叫着说：“死人的脊骨多么结实！别人把一副多么显赫的头衔担子叫他轻快地背着！这些人也够聪明了，坟墓也被虚荣心所利用！”</P>

    他一有机会，总爱说一些温和的讥诮言词，但几乎每次都含着严正的意义。一次，在封斋节，有个年轻的助理主教来到迪涅，在天主堂里讲道。他颇有口才，讲题是“慈善”。他要求富人拯救穷人，以免堕入他尽力形容的那种阴森可怕的地狱，而进入据他所说非常美妙动人的天堂。在当时的听众中，有个叫惹波兰先生的歇了业的商人，这人平时爱放高利贷，在制造大布、哔叽、毛布和高呢帽时赚了五十万。惹波兰先生生平从没有救助过任何穷人。自从那次讲道以后，大家都看见他每逢星期日总拿一个苏①给天主堂大门口的那几个乞讨的老婆婆。她们六个人得去分那个苏。一天，主教撞见他在行那件善事，他笑嘻嘻向他的妹子说：“惹波兰先生又在那儿买他那一个苏的天堂了。”</P>

    谈到慈善事业时，他即使碰壁也不退缩，并还想得出一些耐人寻味的话。一次，他在城里某家客厅里为穷人募捐。在座的有一个商特西侯爵，年老，有钱，吝啬，他有方法同时做极端保王党和极端伏尔泰②派。那样的怪事是有过的。主教走到他跟前，推推他的手臂说：“侯爵先生，您得替我捐几文。”侯爵转过脸去，干脆回答说：“我的主教，我有我自己的穷人呢。” </P>

    ①苏（sou），法国辅币名，相当于二十分之一法郎，即五生丁。</P>

    ②伏尔泰（Voltaire，1694?778），一生强烈反对封建制度和贵族僧侣的统治权。</P>

    “把他们交给我就是了。”主教说。</P>

    一天，在天主堂里，他这样布道：</P>

    “我极敬爱的兄弟们，我的好朋友们，在法国的农村中，有一百三十二万所房子都只有三个洞口；一百八十一万七千所有两个洞口，就是门和窗；还有二十四万六千个棚子都只有一个洞口，那就是门。这是因为那种所谓门窗税才搞到如此地步。请你们替我把一些穷人家、老太婆、小孩子塞在那些房子里吧，瞧有多少热症和疾病！咳！上帝把空气给人，法律却拿空气做买卖。我并不诋毁法律，但是我颂扬上帝。在伊泽尔省，瓦尔省，两个阿尔卑斯省，就是上下阿尔卑斯省，那些农民连小车也没有，他们用自己的背去背肥料；他们没有蜡烛，点的</P>

    是松枝和蘸着松脂的小段绳子。在多菲内省，全部山区也是那样的。他们做一次面包要吃六个月，并且是用干牛粪烘出来的。到了冬天，他们用斧子把那种面包砍开，放在水里浸上二十四个钟头才能吃。我的弟兄们，发发善心吧！看看你们四周的人多么受罪！”</P>

    他出生在南部，所以很容易掌握南方的各种方言。他学下朗格多克省的方言：“Ehbé！moussu，sèssagé？”学下阿尔卑斯省的方言：“Ontéanaraspassa？”学上多菲内省的方言：</P>

    “Puerteunbouenmoutouembeunbouenfroumageg</P>

    rase”</P>

    这样就博得了群众的欢心，大大帮助了他去接近各种各样的人。他在茅屋里或山中，正象在自己的家里，他知道用最俚俗的方言去说明最伟大的事物。他能说各种语言，也就能和一切心灵打成一片。</P>

    并且他对上层的人和人民大众都是一样的。</P>

    他在没有充分了解周围环境时从不粗率地判断一件事。</P>

    他常说：“让我们先研究研究发生这错误的经过吧。”</P>

    他原是个回头的浪子，他也常笑嘻嘻地那样形容自己。他丝毫不唱严格主义的高调；他大力宣传一种教义，但绝不象那些粗暴的卫道者那样横眉怒目，他那教义大致可以这样概括：</P>

    “人有肉体，这肉体同时就是人的负担和诱惑。人拖着它并受它的支配。</P>

    “人应当监视它，约束它，抑制它，必须是到了最后才服从它。在那样的服从里，也还可以有过失；但那样犯下的过失是可蒙赦宥的。那是一种堕落，但只落在膝头上，在祈祷中还可以自赎。</P>

    “做一个圣人，那是特殊情形；做一个正直的人，那却是为人的正轨。你们尽管在歧路徘徊，失足，犯错误，但总应当做个正直的人。</P>

    “尽量少犯错误，这是人的准则；不犯错误，那是天使的梦想。尘世的一切都免不了犯错误。错误就象一种地心吸力。”</P>

    当他看见大家吵闹并且轻易动怒时，他常笑嘻嘻地说：“看来这就是我们大家都在犯的严重罪行呢。现在只因为假面具被揭穿急于申明和掩饰罢了。”</P>

    他对于人类社会所压迫的妇女和穷人总是宽厚的。他说：“凡是妇女、孩子、仆役、没有力量的、贫困的和没有知识的人的过失，都是丈夫、父亲、主人、豪强者、有钱的和有学问的人的过失。”</P>

    他又说：“对无知识的人，你们应当尽你们所能的多多地教给他们；社会的罪在于不办义务教育；它负有制造黑暗的责任。当一个人的心中充满黑暗，罪恶便在那里滋长起来。有罪的并不是犯罪的人，而是那制造黑暗的人。”</P>

    我们看得出，他有一种奇特和独有的批判事物的态度。我怀疑他是从《福音书》中得到这一切的。</P>

    一天，他在一个客厅里听到大家谈一桩正在研究调查、不久就要交付审判的案子。有个穷苦无告的人，为了他对一个女子和所生孩子的爱，在生路断绝时铸了私钱。铸私钱在那个时代是要受极刑的。那女子拿着他所造的第一个私钱去用，被捕了。他们把她抓了起来，但是只有她本人犯罪的证据。只有她一个人能告发她的情人，送他的命。她不肯招供。他们再三追问。她仍坚决不招供。这样，检察长心生一计。他编造她的情人变了心，极巧妙地伪造许多信札的断片，来说服那个苦恼的女人，使她相信她有一个情敌，那男子有负心的行为。在妒恨悲愤之中，她终于举发她的情人，一切都招供了，一切都证实了。那男子是无法挽救了。不久他就得在艾克斯和他的同谋女犯一同受审。大家谈着那件事，每个人都称赞那官员的才干，说他能利用妒嫉之心，因愤怒而真相大白，法律的威力也因报复的心理而得以伸张。主教静悄悄地听着这一切，等到大家说完了，他问道：</P>

    “那一对男女将在什么地方受审？”</P>

    “在地方厅。”</P>

    他又问：“那么，那位检察长将在什么地方受审呢？”</P>

    迪涅发生过一件惨事。有个人因谋害人命而被判处死刑。那个不幸的人并不是什么读书人，但也不是完全无知无识的人，他曾在市集上卖技，也摆过书信摊。城里的人对那案子非常关心。在行刑的前一日，驻狱神甫忽然害了病。必须有个神甫在那受刑的人临终时帮助他。有人去找本堂神甫。他好象有意拒绝，他说：“这不关我事。这种苦差事和那耍把戏的人和我都不相干，我也正害着病，况且那地方下属我的范围。”他这答复传到主教那儿去了。主教说：“本堂神甫说得对。那不属于他的范围，而是属于我的。”</P>

    他立刻跑到监狱去，下到那“耍把戏的人”的牢房里，他叫他的名字，搀着他的手，和他谈话。他在他的身旁整整过了一天一夜，饮食睡眠全忘了，他为那囚犯的灵魂向上帝祈祷，也祈求那囚犯拯救他自己的灵魂。他和他谈着最善的、亦即最简单的真理。他直象他的父亲、兄长、朋友；如果不是在祝福祈祷，他就一点也不象个主教。他在稳定他和安慰他的同时，把一切都教给他了。那个人原是要悲痛绝望而死的。在先，死对他好象是个万丈深渊，他站在那阴惨的边缘上，一面战栗，一面又心胆俱裂地向后退却。他并没有冥顽到对死活也绝不关心的地步。他受到的判决是一种剧烈的震撼，仿佛在他四周的某些地方，把隔在万物的神秘和我们所谓生命中间的那堵墙震倒了。他从那无法补救的缺口不停地望着这世界的外面，而所见的只是一片黑暗。主教却使他见到了一线光明。</P>

    第二天，他们来提这不幸的人了，主教仍在他身旁。他跟着他走。他披上紫披肩，颈上悬着主教的十字架，和那被缚在绳索中的临难人并肩站在大众的面前。</P>

    他和他一同上囚车，一同上断头台。那个受刑的人，昨天是那样愁惨，那样垂头丧气，现在却舒展兴奋起来了。他觉得他的灵魂得了救，他期待着上帝。主教拥抱了他，当刀子将要落下时，他说：“人所杀的人，上帝使他复活；弟兄们所驱逐的人得重见天父。祈祷，信仰，到生命里去。天父就在前面。”他从断头台上下来时，他的目光里有种东西使众人肃然退立。我们不知道究竟哪一样最使人肃然起敬，是他面色的惨白呢，还是他神宇的宁静。在回到他一惯戏称为“他的宫殿”的那所破屋子里时，他对他的妹子说：“我刚刚进行了一场隆重的大典。”</P>

    最卓越的东西也常是最难被人了解的东西，因此，城里有许多人在议论主教那一举动，说那是矫揉造作。不过那是上层阶级客厅里的一种说法。对圣事活动不怀恶意的人民却感动了，并且十分钦佩主教。</P>

    至于主教，对他来说，看断头台行刑确是一种震动；过了许久，他才镇定下来。</P>

    断头台，的确，当它被架起来屹立在那里时，是具有一种使人眩惑的力量的；在我们不曾亲眼见过断头台前，我们对死刑多少还能漠然视之，不表示自己的意见，不置可否；但是，如果我们见到了一座，那种惊骇真是强烈，我们非作出决定，非表示赞同或反对不可。有些人赞叹它，如德·梅斯特尔①。有些人痛恨它，如贝卡里亚②。断头台是法律的体现，它的别名是“镇压”，它不是中立的，也不让人中立。看见它的人都产生最神秘的战栗。所有的社会问题都在那把板斧的四周举起了它们的问号。断头台是想象。断头台不是一个架子。断头台不是一种机器。断头台不是由木条、铁器和绳索所构成的无生气的机械。它好象是种生物，具有一种说不出的阴森森的主动能力。我们可以说那架子能看见，那座机器能听见，那种机械能了解，那些木条铁件和绳索都具有意识。当它的出现把我们的心灵抛入凶恶的梦想时，断头台就显得怪可怕，并和它所作所为的一切都结合在一起了。断头台是刽子手的同伙，它在吞噬东西，在吃肉，在饮血。断头台是法官和木工合造的怪物，是一种鬼怪，它以自己所制造的死亡为生命而进行活动。 </P>

    ①德·梅斯特尔（deMaistre，1753?821），法国神学家。</P>

    ②贝卡里亚（Beccaria，1738?794），意大利启蒙运动的著名代表人物，法学家，主张宽刑。</P>

    那次的印象也确是可怕和深刻的，行刑的第二天和许多天以后，主教还表现出惶惶不可终日的样子。送死时那种强迫的镇静已经消逝了，社会威权下的鬼魂和他纠缠不清，他平时工作回来，素来心安理得，神采奕奕，这时他却老象是在责备自己。有时，他自言自语，吞吞吐吐，低声说着一些凄惨的话。下面是他妹子在一天晚上听了记下来的一段：“我从前还不知道是那么可怕。只专心注意上帝的法则而不关心人的法律，那是错误的。死只属于上帝，人有什么权力过问那件未被认识的事呢？”</P>

    那些印象随着时间渐渐减褪或竟消失了，但是人们察觉到，从此以后，主教总避免经过那刑场。</P>

    人们可以在任何时候把主教叫到病人和临死的人的床边。他深深知道他最大的职责和最大的任务是在那些地方。寡妇和孤女的家，不用请，他自己就会去的。他知道在失去爱妻的男子和失去孩子的母亲身旁静静坐上几个钟头。他既懂得闭口的时刻，也就懂得开口的时刻。呵！可敬可佩的安慰人的人！他不以遗忘来消除苦痛，却希望去使苦痛显得伟大和光荣。他说：“要注意您对死者的想法。不要在那溃烂的东西上去想。定神去看，您就会在穹苍的极尽处看到您亲爱的死者的生命之光。”他知道信仰能护人心身。他总设法去慰藉失望的人，使他们能退一步着想，使俯视墓穴的悲痛转为仰望星光的悲痛。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 5 Monseigneur Bienvenu made his Cassocks last too long

    The private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D---- lived, would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand. </P>

    Like all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little. This brief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated for an hour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own house. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows. Then he set to work. </P>

    A Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day his vicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant, a whole ecclesiastical library to examine,-- prayer-books, diocesan catechisms, books of hours, etc.,--charges to write, sermons to authorize, cures and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, an administrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other the Holy See; and a thousand matters of business. </P>

    What time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, and his offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous, the sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from the afflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes he dug in his garden; again, he read or wrote. He had but one word for both these kinds of toil; he called them gardening. "The mind is a garden," said he. </P>

    Towards mid-day, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He was seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down, supporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment of silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points. </P>

    It was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it. The children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun. He bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything. </P>

    Here and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiled upon the mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any money; when he no longer had any, he visited the rich. </P>

    As he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak. This inconvenienced him somewhat in summer. </P>

    On his return, he dined. The dinner resembled his breakfast. </P>

    At half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame Magloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could be more frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop had one of his cures to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some fine game from the mountains. Every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal: the Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil soup. Thus it was said in the town, when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist. </P>

    After supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing, sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He was a man of letters and rather learned. He left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse in Genesis, In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters. With this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says, The winds of God blew; Flavius Josephus who says, A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth; and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, A wind coming from God blew upon the face of the waters. In another dissertation, he examines the theological works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemais, great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century, under the pseudonym of Barleycourt. </P>

    Sometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled Correspondence of Lord Germain with Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the American station. Versailles, Poincot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot, bookseller, Quai des Augustins. </P>

    Here is the note:-- </P>

    "Oh, you who are! </P>

    "Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the Creator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls you Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you Light; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence; Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man calls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the most beautiful of all your names." </P>

    Toward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor. </P>

    It is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of the dwelling of the Bishop of D----</P>

    米里哀先生的家庭生活，正如他的社会生活那样，是受同样的思想支配的。对那些有机会就近观察的人，迪涅主教所过的那种自甘淡泊的生活，确是严肃而动人。</P>

    和所有老年人及大部分思想家一样，他睡得少，但他的短暂的睡眠却是安稳的。早晨，他静修一个钟头，再念他的弥撒经，有时在天主堂里，有时在自己的经堂里。弥撒经念过以后，作为早餐，他吃一块黑麦面包，蘸着自家的牛的乳汁。随后，他开始工作。</P>

    主教总是相当忙的，他得每天接见主教区的秘书棗通常是一个司祭神甫，并且几乎每天都得接见他的那些助理主教。他有许多会议要主持，整个宗教图书室要检查，还要诵弥撒经、教理问答、日课经等等；还有许多训示要写，许多讲稿要批示，还要和解教士与地方官之间的争执，还要办教务方面的信件、行政方面的信件，一方是政府，一方是宗教，总有作不完的事。</P>

    那些无穷尽的事务和他的日课以及祈祷所余下的时间，他首先用在贫病和痛苦的人身上；在痛苦和贫病的人之后留下的时间，他用在劳动上。他有时在园里铲土，有时阅读和写作。他对那两种工作只有一种叫法，他管这叫“种地”，他说：</P>

    “精神是一种园地。”</P>

    日中，他用午餐。午餐正和他的早餐一样。</P>

    将近两点时，如果天气好，他去乡间或城里散步，时常走进那些破烂的人家。人们看见他独自走着，低着眼睛，扶着一根长拐杖，穿着他那件相当温暖的紫棉袍，脚上穿着紫袜和粗笨的鞋子，头上戴着他的平顶帽，三束金流苏从帽顶的三只角里坠下来。</P>

    他经过的地方就象过节似的。我们可以说他一路走过，就一路在散布温暖和光明。孩子和老人都为主教而走到大门口来，有如迎接阳光。他祝福大家，大家也为他祝福。人们总把他的住所指给任何有所需求的人们看。</P>

    他随处停下来，和小男孩小女孩们谈话，也向着母亲们微笑。他只要有钱，总去找穷人；钱完了，便去找有钱人。</P>

    由于他的道袍穿得太久了，却又不愿被别人察觉，因此他进城就不得不套上那件紫棉袍。在夏季，那是会有点使他不好受的。</P>

    晚上八点半，他和他的妹子进晚餐，马格洛大娘立在他们的后面照应。再没有比那种晚餐更简单的了。但是如果主教留他的一位神甫晚餐，马格洛大娘就借此机会为主教做些鲜美的湖鱼或名贵的野味。所有的神甫都成了预备盛餐的借口，主教也让人摆布。此外，他日常的伙食总不外水煮蔬菜和素油汤。城里的人都说：“主教不吃神甫菜的时候，就吃苦修会的修士菜。”</P>

    晚餐过后，他和巴狄斯丁姑娘与马格洛大娘闲谈半小时，再回到自己的房间从事写作，有时写在单页纸上，有时写在对开本书本的空白边上。他是个文人，知识颇为渊博，他留下了五种或六种相当奇特的手稿，其中一种是关于《创世记》中“上帝的灵运行在水面上”①那一节的研究。他拿三种经文来作比较：阿拉伯译文作“上帝的风吹着”；弗拉菲于斯·约瑟夫②作“上界的风骤临下土”；最后翁格洛斯的迦勒底③文的注释性翻译则作“来自上帝的一阵风吹在水面上”。在另外一篇论文里，他研究了雨果关于神学的著作棗雨果是普托利迈伊斯的主教，本书作者的叔曾祖；他还证明在前世纪以笔名巴勒古尔发表的各种小册子都应是那位主教的。 </P>

    ①这一句话原文见《创世记》第一章第二节。</P>

    ②弗拉菲于斯·约瑟夫（FlaviusJosephe），一世纪末的犹太历史家。</P>

    ③迦勒底（Chaldée），巴比伦一带地方的古称。</P>

    有时，他正在阅读，不问在他手里的是什么书，他会忽然堕入深远的思考，想完以后，立即在原书中写上几行。那样的几行字时常是和他手中的书毫无关系的。目下我们有他在一本四开本书的边上所写的注，书名是《贵人日耳曼和克林东、柯恩华立斯两将军以及美洲海域海军上将们的往来信札》，凡尔赛盘索书店及巴黎奥古斯丁河沿毕索书店印行。</P>

    注是这样的：</P>

    “呵！存在着的你！</P>

    “《传道书》称你为全能，马加比人称你为创造主，《以弗所书》称你为自由，巴录称你为广大，《诗篇》称你为智慧与真理，约翰称你为光明，《列王纪》称你为天主，《出埃及记》呼汝为主宰，《利未记》呼汝为神圣，以斯拉呼汝为公正，《创世记》称你为上帝，人称你为天父，但是所罗门称你为慈悲，这才是你名称中最美的一个。”</P>

    近九点钟时，两位妇女退到楼上自己的房间去，让他独自留在楼下，直到天明。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 6 Who guarded his House for him

    The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground floor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three chambers on the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a garden, a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied the first floor; the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on the street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the third his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory, except by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of hospitality. The Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to D---- </P>

    The pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden a stable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in which the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity of milk they gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital. "I am paying my tithes," he said. </P>

    His bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad weather. As wood is extremely dear at D----, he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his winter salon. </P>

    In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similar sideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory. </P>

    His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D---- had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur's oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor. "The most beautiful of altars," he said, "is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God." </P>

    In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an arm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he received seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the staff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the arm-chair from the bedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors. A room was dismantled for each new guest. </P>

    It sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it was summer. </P>

    There was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw was half gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of service only when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in her own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly been gilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window, as the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture. </P>

    Mademoiselle Baptistine's ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a rose pattern, and with mahogany in swan's neck style, with a sofa. But this would have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncing the idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal? </P>

    Nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop's bedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the bed,--a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet, which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there were two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the other near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two garlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before the table an arm-chair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory. </P>

    Two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented, one the Abbe of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbe Tourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abbe of Grand-Champ, order of Citeaux, diocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after the hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left them. They were priests, and probably donors--two reasons for respecting them. All that he knew about these two persons was, that they had been appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his benefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire having taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowed by time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbe of Grand-Champ with four wafers. </P>

    At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff, which finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a new one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it. This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often called attention to it: "How delightful that is!"he said. </P>

    All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals. </P>

    However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming a hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the Bourgeois. Hence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds. Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole luxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, "That takes nothing from the poor." </P>

    It must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting the Bishop of D---- as he was in reality, we must add that he had said more than once, "I find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes." </P>

    To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks held two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop's chimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table. </P>

    In the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that the key was never removed. </P>

    The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating from a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted the white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some flowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: "Monseigneur, you who turn everything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would be better to grow salads there than bouquets." "Madame Magloire," retorted the Bishop, "you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the useful." He added after a pause, "More so, perhaps." </P>

    This plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost as much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there, trimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into which he dropped seeds. He was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him. Moreover, he made no pretensions to botany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu against Linnaeus. He did not study plants; he loved flowers. He respected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green. </P>

    The house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of the dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral square, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the latch. All that the first passerby had to do at any hour, was to give it a push. At first, the two women had been very much tried by this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D---- had said to them, "Have bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you." They had ended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared it. Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for the Bishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, "This is the shade of difference: the door of the physician should never be shut, the door of the priest should always be open." </P>

    On another book, entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science, he had written this other note: "Am not I a physician like them? I also have my patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates." </P>

    Again he wrote: "Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you. The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter." </P>

    It chanced that a worthy cure, I know not whether it was the cure of Couloubroux or the cure of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether Monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded. The Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said to him, "Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam," Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch who guard it. </P>

    Then he spoke of something else. </P>

    He was fond of saying, "There is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only," he added, "ours must be tranquil."</P>

    他住的房子，我们已经说过，是一所只有一层楼的楼房，楼下三间，楼上三间，顶上一间气楼，后面有一个四分之一亩大的园子。两位妇女住在楼上，主教住在楼下。临街的第一间是他的餐室，第二间是卧室。第三间是经堂。从经堂出来，必须经过卧室；从卧室出来，又必须经过餐室。经堂底里，有半间小暖房，仅容一张留备客人寄宿的床。主教常把那床让给那些因管辖区的事务或需要来到迪涅的乡村神甫们住宿。</P>

    原来医院的药房是间小房子，通正屋，盖在园子里，现在已改为厨房和贮藏食物的地方了。</P>

    此外，园里还有一个牲口棚，最初是救济院的厨房，现在主教在那里养着两头母牛。无论那两头牛供给多少奶，他每天早晨总分一半给医院里的病人。“这是我付的什一税。”他说。</P>

    他的房间相当大，在恶劣的季节里相当难于保暖。由于木柴在迪涅非常贵，他便设法在牛棚里用板壁隔出了一小间。严寒季节便成了他夜间生活的地方。他叫那做“冬斋”。</P>

    在冬斋里，和在餐室里一样，除了一张白木方桌和四张麦秸心椅子外，再也没有旁的家具。餐室里却还陈设着一个涂了淡红胶的旧碗橱。主教还把一张同样的碗橱，适当地罩上白布帷和假花边，作为祭坛，点缀着他的经堂。</P>

    迪涅的那些有钱的女忏悔者和虔诚的妇女，多次凑了些钱，要为主教的经堂修一座美观的新祭坛，他每次把钱收下，却都送给了穷人。</P>

    “最美丽的祭坛，”他说，“是一个因得到安慰而感谢上帝的受苦人的灵魂。”</P>

    他有两张麦秸心的祈祷椅在他的经堂里，卧室里还有一张有扶手的围椅，也是麦秸心的。万一他同时接见七八个人，省长、将军或是驻军的参谋，或是教士培养所的几个学生，他们就得到牛棚里去找冬斋的椅子，经堂里去找祈祷椅，卧室里去找围椅。这样，他们可以收集到十一张待客的坐具。每次有人来访，总得搬空一间屋子。</P>

    有时来了十二个人，主教为了遮掩那种窘境，如果是在冬天，他便自己立在壁炉边，如果是在夏天，他就建议到园里去兜个圈子。</P>

    在那小暖房里，的确还有一张椅子，但是椅上的麦秸已经脱了一半，并且只有三只脚，只是靠在墙上才能用。巴狄斯丁姑娘也还有一张很大的木靠椅，从前是漆过金的，并有锦缎的椅套，但是那靠椅由于楼梯太窄，已从窗口吊上楼了，因而它不能作为机动的家具。</P>

    巴狄斯丁姑娘的奢望是想买一套客厅里用的荷兰黄底团花丝绒的天鹅颈式紫檀座架的家具，再配上长沙发。但是这至少得花五百法郎。她为那样一套东西省吃节用，五年当中，只省下四十二个法郎和十个苏，于是也就不再作此打算。而且谁又能实现自己的理想呢？</P>

    去想象一下主教的卧室，再简单也没有了。一扇窗门朝着园子，对面是床棗一张医院用的病床，铁的，带着绿哔叽帷子。在床里的阴暗处，帷的后面，还摆着梳妆用具，残留着他旧时在繁华社会中做人的那些漂亮习气；两扇门，一扇靠近壁炉，通经堂，一扇靠近书橱，通餐室；那书橱是一个大玻璃橱，装满了书；壁炉的木框，描上了仿大理石的花纹，炉里通常是没有火的；壁炉里有一对铁炉篦，篦的两端装饰着两个瓶，瓶上绕着花串和槽形直条花纹，并贴过银箔，那是主教等级的一种奢侈品；上面，在通常挂镜子的地方，有一个银色已褪的铜十字架，钉在一块破旧的黑线上，装在一个金色暗敝的木框里。窗门旁边，有一张大桌子，摆了一个墨水瓶，桌上堆着零乱的纸张和大本的书籍。桌子前面，一张麦秸椅。床的前面，一张从经堂里搬来的祈祷椅。椭圆框里的两幅半身油画像挂在他床两旁的墙上。在画幅的素净的背景上有几个小金字写在像的旁边，标明一幅是圣克鲁的主教查里奥教士的像，一幅是夏尔特尔教区西多会大田修院院长阿格德的副主教杜尔多教士的像。主教在继医院病人之后住进那间房时，就已看见有这两幅画像，也就让它挂在原处。他们是神甫，也许是施主，这就是使他尊敬他们的两个理由。他所知道关于那两个人物的，只是他们在同一天，一七八五年四月二十七日，由王命，一个授以教区，一个授以采地。马格洛大娘曾把那两幅画取下来掸灰尘，主教才在大田修院院长的像的后面，看见在一张用四片胶纸粘着四角、年久发黄的小方纸上，用淡墨汁注出的这两位人物的出身。</P>

    窗门上，有一条古老的粗毛呢窗帷，已经破旧不堪，为了节省新买一条的费用，马格洛大娘只得在正中大大地缝补一番，缝补的纹恰成一个十字形。主教常常叫人看。</P>

    “这缝得多好！”他说。</P>

    那房子里所有的房间，无论楼下楼上，没有一间不是用灰浆刷的，营房和医院照例如此。</P>

    但是，后来的几年中，马格洛大娘在巴狄斯丁姑娘房间的裱墙纸下面（我们在下面还会谈到），发现了一些壁画。这所房子，在成为医院以前，曾是一些士绅们的聚会场所。所以会有那种装饰。每间屋子的地上都铺了红砖，每星期洗一次，床的前面都铺着麦秸席。总之，这住宅，经那两位妇女的照料，从上到下，都变得异常清洁。那是主教所许可的唯一的奢华。他说：</P>

    “这并不损害穷人的利益。”</P>

    但是我们得说清楚，在他从前有过的东西里，还留下六套银餐具和一只银的大汤勺，马格洛大娘每天都喜洋洋地望着那些银器在白粗布台毯上放射着灿烂夺目的光。我们既然要把迪涅的这位主教据实地写出来，就应当提到他曾几次这样说过：“叫我不用银器盛东西吃，我想是不容易做到的。”</P>

    在那些银器以外，还有两个粗重的银烛台，是从他一个姑祖母的遗产中得来的。那对烛台上插着两支烛，经常陈设在主教的壁炉上。每逢他留客进餐，马格洛大娘总点上那两支烛，连着蜡台放在餐桌上。</P>

    在主教的卧室里，床头边，有一张壁橱，每天晚上，马格洛大娘把那六套银器和大汤勺塞在橱里，橱门上的钥匙是从来不拿走的。</P>

    那个园子，在我们说过的那些相当丑陋的建筑物的陪衬下，也显得有些减色。园子里有四条小道，交叉成十字形，交叉处有一个水槽；另一条小道沿着白围墙绕园一周。小道与小道之间，形成四块方地，边沿上种了黄杨。马格洛大娘在三块方地上种着蔬菜，在第四块上，主教种了些花卉。几株果树散布在各处。</P>

    一次，马格洛大娘和蔼地打趣他说：“您处处都盘算，这儿却有一块方地没有用上。种上些生菜，不比花好吗？”“马格洛大娘，”主教回答说，“您弄错了。美和适用是一样有用的。”停了一会，他又加上一句：“也许更有用些。”</P>

    那块方地又分作三四畦，主教在那地上所费的劳力和他在书本里所费的劳力是一样的。他乐意在这里花上一两个钟头，修枝，除草，这儿那儿，在土里搠一些窟窿，摆下种子。他并不象园艺工作者那样仇视昆虫。对植物学他没有任何幻想；他不知道分科，也不懂骨肉发病说；他绝不研究在杜纳福尔①和自然操作法之间应当有何取舍，既不替胞囊反对子叶，也不替舒习尔②反对林内③。他不研究植物，而赞赏花卉。他非常敬重科学家，更敬重无知识的人，在双方并重之下，每当夏季黄昏，他总提着一把绿漆白铁喷壶去浇他的花畦。 </P>

    ①杜纳福尔（Tournefort），法国十世纪的植物学家。</P>

    ②舒习尔（Jussieu），法国十八世纪植物学家。</P>

    ③林内（Linné），瑞典十八世纪生物学家，是植物和动物分类学的鼻祖。</P>

    那所房子没有一扇门是锁得上的。餐室的门，我们已经说过，开出去便是天主堂前面的广场，从前是装了锁和铁闩的，正象一扇牢门。主教早已叫人把那些铁件取去了，因而那扇门，无论昼夜，都只用一个活梢扣着。任何过路的人，在任何时刻，都可以摇开。起初，那两位妇女为了那扇从来不关的门非常发愁，但是迪涅主教对她们说：“假如你们喜欢，不妨在你们的房门上装上铁闩。”到后来，她们看见他既然放心，也就放了心，或者说，至少她们装出放心的样子。马格洛大娘有时仍不免提心吊胆。主教的想法，已经在他在《圣经》边上所写的这三行字里说明了，至少是提出了：“这里只有最微小的一点区别：</P>

    医生的门，永不应关，教士的门，应常开着。”</P>

    在一本叫做《医学的哲学》的书上，他写了这样一段话：“难道我们不和他们一样是医生吗？我一样有我的病人。首先我有他们称为病人的病人，其次我还有我称为不幸的人的病人。”</P>

    在另一处，他还写道：“对向你求宿的人，不可问名问姓，不便把自己姓名告人的人也往往是最需要找地方住的人。”</P>

    有一天，忽然来了个大名鼎鼎的教士，我已经记不清是古娄布鲁教士，还是彭弼力教士，想起要问主教先生（那也许是受了马格洛大娘的指使），让大门日夜开着，人人都可以进来，主教是否十分有把握不至于发生某种意外，是否不怕在那防范如此松懈的家里，发生什么不幸的事。主教严肃而温和地在他肩上点了一下，对他说：“除非上帝要保护这家人，否则看守也徒然。”①他接着就谈旁的事。 </P>

    ①这两句话原文为拉丁文，即DisiDominuscustodieritdomum，invanumvigilantquicustodiunteam。</P>

    他常爱说：“教士有教士的勇敢，正如龙骑队长有龙骑队长的勇敢。”不过，他又加上一句：“我们的勇敢应当是宁静的。”</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 7 Cravatte

    It is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not omit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the Bishop of D---- was. </P>

    After the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bes, who had infested the gorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in the mountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the remnant of Gaspard Bes's troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his way to Piedmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of Barcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid himself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l'Aigle, and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and Ubayette. </P>

    He even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, and despoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the country-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He always escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a bold wretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was making his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to meet him, and urged him to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose. </P>

    "Therefore," said the Bishop, "I intend to go without escort." </P>

    "You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!" exclaimed the mayor. </P>

    "I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, and shall set out in an hour." </P>

    "Set out?" </P>

    "Set out." </P>

    "Alone?" </P>

    "Alone." </P>

    "Monseigneur, you will not do that!" </P>

    "There exists yonder in the mountains," said the Bishop, a tiny community no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years. They are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds. They own one goat out of every thirty that they tend. They make very pretty woollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes. They need to be told of the good God now and then. What would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would they say if I did not go?" </P>

    "But the brigands, Monseigneur?" </P>

    "Hold," said the Bishop, "I must think of that. You are right. I may meet them. They, too, need to be told of the good God." </P>

    "But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!" </P>

    "Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows the ways of Providence?" </P>

    "They will rob you, Monseigneur." </P>

    "I have nothing." </P>

    "They will kill you." </P>

    "An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? Bah! To what purpose?" </P>

    "Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!" </P>

    "I should beg alms of them for my poor." </P>

    "Do not go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking your life!" </P>

    "Monsieur le maire," said the Bishop, "is that really all? </P>

    I am not in the world to guard my own life, but to guard souls." </P>

    They had to allow him to do as he pleased. He set out, accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide. His obstinacy was bruited about the country-side, and caused great consternation. </P>

    He would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed the mountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his "good friends," the shepherds. He remained there for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching, exhorting. When the time of his departure approached, he resolved to chant a Te Deum pontifically. He mentioned it to the cure. But what was to be done? There were no episcopal ornaments. They could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace. </P>

    "Bah!" said the Bishop. "Let us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit, nevertheless, Monsieur le Cure. Things will arrange themselves." </P>

    They instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly. </P>

    While they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who departed on the instant. The chest was opened; it contained a cope of cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop's cross, a magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun. In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written, "From Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu." </P>

    "Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?" said the Bishop. Then he added, with a smile, "To him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop." </P>

    "Monseigneur," murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile. "God--or the Devil." </P>

    The Bishop looked steadily at the cure, and repeated with authority, "God!" </P>

    When he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity, all along the road. At the priest's house in Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting for him, and he said to his sister: "Well! Was I in the right? The poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral." </P>

    That evening, before he went to bed, he said again: "Let us never fear robbers nor murderers. Those are dangers from without, petty dangers. Let us fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers. The great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it what threatens our head or our purse! Let us think only of that which threatens our soul." </P>

    Then, turning to his sister: "Sister, never a precaution on the part of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God permits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a danger is approaching us. Let us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account." </P>

    However, such incidents were rare in his life. We relate those of which we know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment. One month of his year resembled one hour of his day. </P>

    As to what became of "the treasure" of the cathedral of Embrun, we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolen they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor. However, we make no assertions on this point. Only, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couched in these terms, "The question is, to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital."</P>

    此地自然有着一件我们不应忽略的事，因为这件事足以说明迪涅的这位主教先生是怎样一个人。</P>

    加斯帕尔·白匪帮曾一度横行在阿柳尔峡一带，在被击溃以后，有个叫克拉华特的部将却还躲在山林里。他领着他的徒众，加斯帕尔·白的残部，在尼斯伯爵领地里藏匿了一些时候，继又转到皮埃蒙特区①，忽而又在法国境内巴塞隆内特附近出现。最初，有人曾在若齐埃见过他，过后又在翟伊尔见过他。他躲在鹰轭山洞里，从那里出来，经过玉碑和小玉碑峡谷，走向村落和乡镇。他甚至敢于进逼昂布伦，黑夜侵入天主堂，卷走圣衣库中的东西。他的劫掠使那一乡的人惴惴不安。警察追击也无用。他屡次逃脱，有时还公然抵抗。他是个大胆的恶汉。正当人心惶惶时主教来了。他正在那一乡巡视。乡长赶到沙斯特拉来找他，并且劝他转回去。当时克拉华特已占据那座山，直达阿什一带，甚至还更远。即使由卫队护送，也有危险。那不过是把三四个警察白白拿去送死罢了。 </P>

    ①皮埃蒙特区（Piémont），在意大利北部。</P>

    “那么，”主教说，“我打算不带卫兵去。”</P>

    “您怎么可以那样打算，主教？”那乡长说。</P>

    “我就那样打算，我绝对拒绝卫兵，并且一个钟头以内我就要走。”</P>

    “走？”</P>

    “走。”</P>

    “一个人去吗？”</P>

    “一个人。”</P>

    “主教，您不能那样做。”</P>

    “在那儿，”主教又说，“有个穷苦的小村子，才这么一点大，我三年没有见着他们了。那里的人都是我的好朋友。一些和蔼诚实的牧人。他们牧羊，每三十头母羊里有一头是属于他们自己的。他们能做各种颜色的羊毛绳，非常好看。他们用六孔小笛吹各种山歌。他们需要有人不时和他们谈谈慈悲的上帝。主教如果也害怕，他们将说什么呢？假使我不到那里去一下，他们将说些什么呢？”</P>

    “可是，主教，您对那些强盗怎么办，万一您遇见了强盗！”</P>

    “对呀，”主教说，“我想起来了。您说得有理。我可以遇见他们。他们也需要有人和他们谈谈慈悲的上帝。”</P>

    “主教，那是一伙土匪呀，是一群狼呀！”</P>

    “乡长先生，也许耶稣正要我去当那一群狼的牧人呢，谁知道主宰的旨意？”</P>

    “主教，他们会把您抢光的。”</P>

    “我没有什么可抢的。”</P>

    “他们会杀害您的。”</P>

    “杀害一个念着消食经过路的老教士？啐！那有什么好处？”</P>

    “唉！我的上帝！万一您碰见他们！”</P>

    “我就请他们捐几文给我的穷人们。”</P>

    “主教，以上天之名，不要到那儿去吧！您冒着生命危险呢。”</P>

    “乡长先生，”主教说，“就只是这点小事吗？我活在世上不是为了自己的生命，而是来保护世人的心灵的。”</P>

    只好让他走。他走了，只有一个自愿当向导的小孩伴着他。他那种蛮劲使那一乡议论纷纷，甚至个个替他捏一把汗。</P>

    他不愿带他的妹子，也没有带马格洛大娘。他骑上骡子，穿过山路，一个人也没有碰见，平平安安到了他的“好朋友”棗牧人的家里。他在那里住了两星期，传道，行圣礼，教育人，感化人。到了快离开时，他决计用主教的仪式做一场大弥撒。他和本堂神甫商量。但是怎么办呢？没有主教的服饰。他们只能把简陋的乡间圣衣库供他使用，那里只有几件破旧的、装着假金线的锦缎祭服。</P>

    “没有关系！”主教说。“神甫先生，我们不妨把要做大弥撤那件事在下次礼拜时，向大众宣告一下，会有办法的。”</P>

    在附近的几个天主堂里都寻遍了。那些穷教堂里所有的精华，凑拢来还不能适当装饰一个大天主堂里的唱诗童子。</P>

    正在大家为难时，有两个陌生人，骑着马，带了一只大箱子，送来给主教先生，箱子放在本堂神甫家里人立即走了。打开箱子一看，里面有件金线呢披氅，一顶装有金刚钻的主教法冠，一个大主教的十字架，一条华美的法杖，一个月以前，在昂布伦圣母堂的圣衣库里被抢的法衣，全部都在。箱子里有张纸，上面写着：“克拉华特呈奉卞福汝主教。”</P>

    “我早说过会有办法的！”主教说，随后他含笑补充一句，“以神甫的白衣自足的人蒙上帝赐来大主教的披氅了。”</P>

    “我的主教，”神甫点头含笑低声说，“不是上帝便是魔鬼。”</P>

    主教用眼睛盯住神甫，一本正经地说：“是上帝！”</P>

    回沙斯特拉时一路上都有人来看他，引为奇谈。他在沙斯特拉的神甫家里，又和巴狄斯丁姑娘和马格洛大娘相见了，她们也正渴望他回来。他对他的妹子说：</P>

    “怎样，我的打算没有错吧？我这穷教士，两手空空，跑到山里那些穷百姓家里去过了，现在又满载而归。我当初出发时，只带着一片信仰上帝的诚心，回来时，却把一个天主堂的宝库带回了。”</P>

    晚上，他在睡前还说：</P>

    “永远不要害怕盗贼和杀人犯。那是身外的危险。我们应当害怕自己。偏见便是盗贼，恶习便是杀人犯。重大的危险都在我们自己的心里。危害我们脑袋和钱袋的人何足介意呢？我们只须想到危害灵魂的东西就得了。”</P>

    他又转过去对他妹子说：</P>

    “妹妹，教士永远不可提防他的邻人。邻人做的事，总是上帝允许的。我们在危险临头时，只应祷告上帝。祈求他，不是为了我们自己，而是为了不要让我们的兄弟因我们而犯罪。”</P>

    总之，他生平的特殊事故不多。我们就自己所知道的谈谈。不过他在他一生中，总是在同样的时刻做同样的事。他一年的一月，就象他一日的一时。</P>

    至于昂布伦天主堂的“财宝”下落如何，我们对这问题，却有些难于回答。那都是些美丽的、令人爱不忍释的、很值得偷去救济穷人的东西。况且那些东西是早已被人偷过了的。那种冒险行为已经完成了一半，余下的工作只须改变偷窃的目的，再向穷人那边走一小段路就可以了。关于这问题，我们什么也不肯定。不过，曾经有人在主教的纸堆里发现过一张词意不明的条子，也许正是指那件事的，上面写着：“问题在于明确这东两应当归天主堂还是归医院。”</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 8 Philosophy after Drinking

    The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had marched straight to his goal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest. He was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by any means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid. He was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the "Crotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop." He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him. </P>

    On some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:-- </P>

    "Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion. It is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking. We are two augurs. I am going to make a confession to you. I have a philosophy of my own." </P>

    "And you are right," replied the Bishop. "As one makes one's philosophy, so one lies on it. You are on the bed of purple, senator." </P>

    The senator was encouraged, and went on:-- </P>

    "Let us be good fellows." </P>

    "Good devils even," said the Bishop. </P>

    "I declare to you," continued the senator, "that the Marquis d'Argens, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges." </P>

    "Like yourself, Count," interposed the Bishop. </P>

    The senator resumed:-- </P>

    "I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist, a believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire made sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham's eels prove that God is useless. A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux. Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you have the world. Man is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father? The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop. It is good for nothing but to produce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow. Down with that great All, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace! Between you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make confession to my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that I have good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity. 'Tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars. Renunciation; why? Sacrifice; to what end? I do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf. Let us stick to nature, then. We are at the top; let us have a superior philosophy. What is the advantage of being at the top, if one sees no further than the end of other people's noses? Let us live merrily. Life is all. That man has another future elsewhere, on high, below, anywhere, I don't believe; not one single word of it. Ah! sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must take heed to everything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over the just and the unjust, over the fas and the nefas. Why? Because I shall have to render an account of my actions. When? After death. What a fine dream! After my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me. Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can. Let us tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the veil of Isis: there is no such thing as either good or evil; there is vegetation. Let us seek the real. Let us get to the bottom of it. Let us go into it thoroughly. What the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it! We must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it. Then it gives you exquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh. I am square on the bottom, I am. Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for dead men's shoes. Ah! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What a fine lot Adam has! We are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wings on our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star? Very well. We shall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, we shall see God. Ta, ta, ta! What twaddle all these paradises are! God is a nonsensical monster. I would not say that in the Moniteur, egad! but I may whisper it among friends. Inter pocula. To sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow. Be the dupe of the infinite! I'm not such a fool. I am a nought. I call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought, senator. Did I exist before my birth? No. Shall I exist after death? No. What am I? A little dust collected in an organism. What am I to do on this earth? The choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy. Whither will suffering lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have suffered. Whither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have enjoyed myself. My choice is made. One must eat or be eaten. I shall eat. It is better to be the tooth than the grass. Such is my wisdom. After which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole. End. Finis. Total liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject. Fables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men. No; our to-morrow is the night. Beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness. You have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul--it makes no difference. That is the truth. Then live your life, above all things. Make use of your _I_ while you have it. In truth, Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I have my philosophers. I don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense. Of course, there must be something for those who are down,--for the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches. Legends, chimeras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow. They gobble it down. They spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else has the good. God. That is the least he can have. I oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for myself. The good God is good for the populace." </P>

    The Bishop clapped his hands. </P>

    "That's talking!" he exclaimed. "What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it can have it. Ah! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidly allow one's self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished. How agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator. Nevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you. You great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably. This philosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers. But you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor."</P>

    我们曾经谈到过一个元老院元老，那是个精明果断的人，一生行事，直截了当，对于人生所能遇到的难题，如良心、信誓、公道、天职之类从不介怀；他一往直前地向着他的目标走去，在他个人发达和利益的道路上，他从不曾动摇过一次。他从前当过检察官，因处境顺利，为人也渐趋温和了，他绝不是个有坏心眼的人。他在生活中审慎地抓住那些好的地方、好的机会和好的财源之后，对儿子、女婿、亲戚甚至朋友，也尽力帮些小忙。其余的事，在他看来，好象全是傻事。他善诙谐，通文墨，因而自以为是伊壁鸠鲁①的信徒，实际上也许只是比戈·勒白朗②之流亚。对无边的宇宙和永恒的事业以及“主教老头儿的种种无稽之谈”，他常喜欢用解颐的妙语来加以述说。有时，他会带着和蔼的高傲气派当面嘲笑米里哀先生，米里哀先生总由他嘲笑。 </P>

    ①伊壁鸠鲁（Epicure，公元前341?70），希腊唯物主义哲学家，主张享乐，他的所谓享乐是精神恬静愉快，不动心。</P>

    ②比戈·勒白朗（PigaultLebrun），十八世纪法国色情小说家。</P>

    不知是在举行什么半官式典礼时，那位伯爵（就是那位元老）和米里哀先生都应在省长公馆里参加宴会。到了用甜品时，这位元老已经略带酒意，不过态度仍旧庄重，他大声说：“主教先生，我们来扯扯。一个元老和一个主教见了面，就难免要彼此挤眉弄眼。一狼一狈，心照不宣。我要和您谈句知心话。我有我自己一套哲学。”</P>

    “您说得对，”主教回答，“人总是睡下来搞他的哲学的，何况您是睡在金屋玉堂中的，元老先生。”</P>

    元老兴致勃发，接着说：</P>

    “让我们做好孩子。”</P>

    “就做顽皮鬼也不打紧。”主教说。</P>

    “我告诉您，”元老说，“阿尔让斯侯爵、皮隆、霍布斯、内戎①先生这些人都不是等闲之辈。在我的图书室里的这些哲学家的书边上都是烫了金的。”</P>

    “和您自己一样，元老先生。”主教抢着说。</P>

    元老接着说：</P>

    “我恨狄德罗②，他是个空想家，大言不惭，还搞革命，实际上却信仰上帝，比伏尔泰更着迷。伏尔泰嘲笑过尼登，他不应当那么做，因为尼登的鳝鱼已经证明上帝的无用了。一匙面糊加一滴酸醋，便可以代替圣灵。假设那一滴再大一点，那一匙也再大一点，便是这世界了。人就是鳝鱼。又何必要永生之父呢？主教先生，关于耶和华的那种假设叫我头痛。它只对那些外弱中干的人有些用处。打倒那个惹人厌烦的万物之主！虚空万岁！虚空才能叫人安心。说句知心话，并且我要说个痛快，好好向我的牧师交代一番，我告诉您，我观点明确。您那位东劝人谦让、西劝人牺牲的耶稣瞒不过我的眼睛。那种说法是吝啬鬼对穷鬼的劝告。谦让！为什么？牺牲！为什么？我从来没有见过一只狼为另一只狼的幸福而牺牲它自己。我们还是游戏人间的好。人为万物之灵。我们应当有高明的哲学。假使目光如鼠，又何必生为万物之灵？让我们嘻嘻哈哈过这一世吧。人生，就是一切。说人在旁的地方，天上、地下，某处，有另外一个来生，我绝不信那些鬼话。哼！有人要我谦让，要我牺牲，那么，一举一动，我都得谨慎小心，我得为善恶、曲直、从违等问题来伤脑筋。为什么？据说对自己的行为我将来得做个交代。什么时候？死后。多么好的梦！在我死了以后，有人捉得住我那才妙呢。您去叫一只鬼手抓把灰给我看看。我们都是过来人，都是揭过英蓉仙子的亵衣的人，让我们说老实话吧，这世上只有生物，既无所谓善，也无所谓恶。我们应当追求实际，一直深入下去，穷其究竟，有什么大不了的！我们应当嗅出真理，根究到底，把真理掌握在自己的手里。那样它才会给你一种无上的快乐。那样你才会充满信心，仰天大笑。我一点不含糊，我。主教先生，永生之说只能哄哄小孩。哈！多么中听的诺言！您去信您的吧！骗鬼的空头支票。人是灵魂，人可以成为天使，人可以在肩胛骨上生出一对蓝翅膀。有福气的人可以从这一个星球游到那一个星球，这句话是不是德尔图良③说的，请您告诉我。就算是的。我们会变成星际间的蝗虫。还会看见上帝，等等，等等。什么天堂，妄谈而已。上帝是种荒谬透顶的胡说。我当然不会在政府公报里说这种话。朋友之间，却不妨悄悄地谈谈。酒后之言嘛。为了天堂牺牲人世，等于捕雀而捉影。为永生之说所愚弄！还不至于那么蠢。我是一无所有的。我叫做一无所有伯爵。元老院元老。在我生前，有我吗？没有。在我死后，有我吗？没有。我是什么呢？我不过是一粒和有机体组合起来的尘土。在这世界上，我有什么事要做？我可以选择，受苦或享乐。受苦，那会把我引到什么地方去呢？引到一无所有。而我得受一辈子的苦。享乐又会把我引到什么地方去呢？也是引到一无所有。而我可以享一辈子的乐。我已经选定了。不吃就得被吃。做牙齿总比做草料好些。那正是我聪明的地方。过后，听其自然，掘坟坑的人会来的，坟坑便是我们这种人的先贤祠，一切都落在那大洞里。完事大吉。一切皆空。全部清算完毕。那正是一切化为乌有的下场。连死的份儿也不会再有了，请相信我。说什么还有一个人在等着我去谈话，我想来就要发笑。奶妈的创作。奶妈发明了妖怪来吓唬小孩，也发明了耶和华来吓唬大人。不，我们的明天是一片黑。在坟墓的后面，一无所有，这对任何人来说也都一样。即使你做过萨尔达尼拔④，即使你做过味增爵⑤，结果都一样归于乌有。这是真话。因此，享乐高于一切。当你还有你的时候，就应当利用这个你。老实说，我告诉您，主教先生，我有我的一套哲学，也有我的同道。我不让那些无稽之谈牵着我的鼻子走。可是，对于那些下等人，那些赤脚鬼、穷光蛋、无赖汉，却应当有一种东西。我们不妨享以种种传说、幻想、灵魂、永生、天堂、星宿。让他们大嚼特嚼，让他们拿去涂在他们的干面包上。两手空空的人总算也还捧着一位慈悲的上帝。那并不过分。我也一点不反对，但为我自己，我还是要留下我的内戎先生。慈悲的上帝对平民来说，还是必要的。” </P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 9 The Brother as depicted by the Sister

    In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her childhood. This letter is in our possession. </P>

    D----, Dec. 16, 18--. </P>

    MY GOOD MADAM: Not a day passes without our speaking of you. It is our established custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours. Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath. My drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers. But my room is the one you ought to see. Madam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable. The subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes me. In short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night. What shall I say to you? I have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum. She has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany. </P>

    I am always very happy. My brother is so good. He gives all he has to the poor and sick. We are very much cramped. The country is trying in the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need. We are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are great treats. </P>

    My brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishop ought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened. Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He fears nothing, even at night. That is his sort of bravery, he says. </P>

    He does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it. One must know how to understand him. </P>

    He goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night. </P>

    Last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers. He would not take us. He was absent for a fortnight. On his return nothing had happened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and said, "This is the way I have been robbed!" And then he opened a trunk full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the thieves had given him. </P>

    When he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding him a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear me. </P>

    At first I used to say to myself, "There are no dangers which will stop him; he is terrible." Now I have ended by getting used to it. I make a sign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself as he sees fit. I carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray for him and fall asleep. I am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would be the end of me. I should go to the good God with my brother and my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences. But now the habit has been acquired. We pray together, we tremble together, and we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter this house, he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there for us to fear in this house? There is always some one with us who is stronger than we. The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here. </P>

    This suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me. I understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves to the care of Providence. That is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul. </P>

    I have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the Faux family. You are aware that he knows everything, and that he has memories, because he is still a very good royalist. They really are a very ancient Norman family of the generalship of Caen. Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, a Jean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whom was a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre, and was commander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne. His daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son of the Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards, and lieutenant-general of the army. It is written Faux, Fauq, and Faoucq. </P>

    Good Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative, Monsieur the Cardinal. As for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me. She is well, works as you would wish, and loves me. </P>

    That is all that I desire. The souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely, and it makes me very happy. My health is not so very bad, and yet I grow thinner every day. Farewell; my paper is at an end, and this forces me to leave you. A thousand good wishes. BAPTISTINE. </P>

    P.S. Your grand nephew is charming. Do you know that he will soon be five years old? Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on knee-caps, and he said, "What has he got on his knees?" He is a charming child! His little brother is dragging an old broom about the room, like a carriage, and saying, "Hu!" </P>

    As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how to mould themselves to the Bishop's ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. The Bishop of D----, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and magnificent, without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, but they let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign,in any action once entered upon. At certain moments, without his having occasion to mention it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability, so perfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house. They served him passively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared. They understood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certain cares may be put under constraint. Thus, even when believing him to be in peril, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided him to God. </P>

    Moreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother's end would prove her own. Madame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.</P>

    为了说明迪涅主教先生的家庭概况，为了说明那两位圣女怎样用她们的行动、思想、甚至女性的那种易受惊恐的本能去屈从主教的习惯和意愿，使他连开口吩咐的麻烦都没有，我们最好是在此地把巴狄斯丁姑娘写给她幼年时的朋友，波瓦舍佛隆子爵夫人的一封信转录下来。那封信在我们的手里。</P>

    我仁慈的夫人，我们没有一天不谈到您。那固然是我们的习惯，也还有另外一个理由。您没有想到，马格洛大娘居然在洗刷天花板和墙壁时，发现了许多东西。现在我们这两间原来裱着旧纸、刷过灰浆的房间，和您那子爵府第相比，也不至于再有逊色。马格洛大娘撕去了全部的纸。那下面有些东西。我们用来晾衣服，没有家具的那间客厅，有十五尺高，十八尺见方，天花板和梁上都画了仿古金花，正和府上一样。从前当作医院时，它是用块布遮住了的。还有我们祖母时代的板壁。不过应当看看的是我的房间。马格洛大娘在那至少有十层的裱墙纸下发现了一些油画，虽然不好，却还过得去。画的是密涅瓦①封忒勒玛科斯②为骑士。另一幅园景里也有他。那花园的名字我一时想不起了。总之是罗马贵妇们在某一夜到过的地方。我还要说什么？那上面有罗马（这儿有个字，字迹不明）男子和妇女以及他们的全部侍从。马格洛大娘把一切都擦拭干净，今年夏天，她还要修整几处小小的破损，全部重行油漆，我的屋子就会变成一间真正的油画陈列馆了。她还在顶楼角落里找出两只古式壁儿。可是重上一次金漆就得花去两枚值六利弗的银币，还不如留给穷人们使用好些；并且式样也相当丑陋，我觉得如果能有一张紫檀木圆桌，我还更合意些。 </P>

    ①密涅瓦（Minerva），艺术和智慧之神。</P>

    ②忒勒玛科斯（Télémaque），智勇之神。</P>

    我总是过得很快乐。我哥是那么仁厚，他把他所有的一切都施给穷人和病人。我们手边非常拮据。到了冬天这地方就很苦。帮助穷人总是应当的。我们还算有火有灯。您瞧，这样已经很温暖了。</P>

    我哥有他独特的习惯。他在聊天时，老说一个主教应当这样。您想想，我们家里的大门总是不关的。任何人都可以闯进来，并且开了门就是我哥的屋子。他什么都不怕，连黑夜也不怕。照他说来，那是他特有的果敢。</P>

    他不要我替他担忧，也不要马格洛大娘替他担忧。他冒着各种危险，还不许我们有感到危险的神情。我们应当知道怎样去领会他。</P>

    他常在下雨时出门，在水里行走，在严冬旅行。他不怕黑夜，不怕可疑的道路和遭遇。</P>

    去年，他独自一人走到匪窟里去了。他不肯带我们去。他去了两星期。一直到回来，他什么危险也没碰着。我们以为他死了，而他却健康得很。他还说你们看我被劫了没有。他打开一只大箱子，里面装满了昂布伦天主堂的珍宝，是那些土匪送给他的。那一次，在他回来时，我和他的几位朋友，到两里路远的地方去迎接他。我实在不得不稍微责备他几句，但是我很小心，只在车轮响时才说话，免得旁人听见。</P>

    起初，我常对自己说：“没有什么危险能阻拦他，他真够叫人焦急的了。”到现在，我也习惯了。我常向马格洛大娘使眼色叫她不要惹他。他要冒险，让他去。我引着马格洛大娘回我的房间。我为他祷告。我睡我的觉。我安心，因为我知道，万一他遇到不幸，我也决不再活了。我要随着我的哥兼我的主教一同归天。马格洛大娘对她所谓的“他的粗心大意”却看不惯，但是到现在，习惯已成自然。我们俩一同害怕，一同祈祷，也就一同睡去了。魔鬼可以走进那些可以让它放肆的人家，但在我们家里，有什么可怕的呢？最强的那位时常是和我们同在一道的，魔鬼可以经过此地，但是慈悲的上帝常住在我们家里。</P>

    这样我已经满足了。我的哥，现在用不着再吩咐我什么，他不开口，我也能领会他的意思。我们把自己交给了天主。</P>

    这就是我们和一个胸襟开阔的人相处之道。</P>

    您问我关于傅家的历史，这事我已向我哥问明了。您知道，他知道得多么清楚，记得多么详细呵。因为他始终是一个非常忠实的保王党。那的确是卡昂税区一家很老的诺曼底世家。五百年来，有一个拉乌尔·德·傅，一个让·德·傅和一个托马·德·傅，都是贵人，其中一个是罗什福尔采地的领主。最末的一个是居伊·艾蒂安·亚历山大，·路易丝嫁给了法兰西世卿，法兰西警卫军大佐和陆军中将路易·德·格勒蒙的儿子阿德利安·查理·德·格勒蒙。他们的姓，傅，有三种写法：Faux，Fauq，Faoucq。仁慈的夫人，请您代求贵戚红衣主教先生为我们祷告。至于您亲爱的西尔华尼，她没有浪费她亲近您的短暂时间来和我写信，那是对的。她既然身体好，也能依照尊意工作，并且仍旧爱我，那已是我所希望的一切了。我从尊处得到她的问候，我感到幸福。我的身体并不太坏，可是一天比一天消瘦下去了。再谈，纸已写满了，我只得停笔。一切安好。</P>

    巴狄斯丁</P>

    一八……年，十二月十六日，于迪涅。</P>

    再者：令嫂仍和她令郎的家眷住在此地。您的侄孙真可爱。您知道，他快五岁了！昨天他看见一匹马走过，腿上裹了护膝，他说：“它膝头上是什么？”那孩子，他是那样惹人爱。他的小兄弟在屋子里拖着一把破扫帚当车子，嘴里还喊着：“走！”</P>

    从这封信里我们可以看出，那两位妇人知道用女性所特有的那种比男子更了解男子的天才，去曲承主教的生活方式。迪涅那位主教有着那种始终不渝、温和敦厚的神情风度，有时作出一些伟大、果敢、辉煌的行动，仿佛连他自己也不觉得。她们为那些事提心吊胆，但是让他去做。马格洛大娘有时试着在事先劝劝，但从不在事情进行时或事后多话。当行动已经开始，她们就从不阻拦他，连一点颜色也不表露。某些时候，她们只似懂非懂地觉得他是在尽主教的职责；他自己并不说出，甚至连他自己也不一定有那种感觉，因为他的那种赤子之心是那样淳朴，因此，她们在家里只是两个黑影。她们被动地服侍着他，如果为了服从，应当退避，她们便退避。由于一种可喜的、体贴入微的本能，她们知道，某种关切反而会使他为难。我不说她们能了解他的思想，但是她们了解他的性格，因而即使知道他是在危险中，也只好不过问。她们把他托付给了上帝。</P>

    而且巴狄斯丁还常说，正如我们刚才念过的，她哥的不幸也就是她自己的末日。马格洛大娘没有那样说，但是她心里有数。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 10 The Bishop in the Presence of an Unknown Light

    At an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to be believed, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits. In the country near D---- a man lived quite alone. This man, we will state at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G---- </P>

    Member of the Convention, G---- was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of D---- A member of the Convention--can you imagine such a thing? That existed from the time when people called each other thou, and when they said "citizen." This man was almost a monster. He had not voted for the death of the king, but almost. He was a quasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of the legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you please; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for life. An example, in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like all the rest of those people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture. </P>

    Was G---- a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had not voted for the death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and had been able to remain in France. </P>

    He dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild valley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, it was said, a sort of field, a hole, a lair. There were no neighbors, not even passers-by. Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman. </P>

    Nevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, "There is a soul yonder which is lonely." </P>

    And he added, deep in his own mind, "I owe him a visit." </P>

    But, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush, appeared to him after a moment's reflection, as strange, impossible, and almost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement. </P>

    Still, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No. But what a sheep! </P>

    The good Bishop was perplexed. Sometimes he set out in that direction; then he returned. </P>

    Finally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was gaining on him, and that he would not live over night.--"Thank God!" some added. </P>

    The Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out. </P>

    The sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating of the heart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs, entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of boldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern. </P>

    It was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed against the outside. </P>

    Near the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants, there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun. </P>

    Near the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offering the old man a jar of milk. </P>

    While the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke: "Thank you," he said, "I need nothing." And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child. </P>

    The Bishop stepped forward. At the sound which he made in walking, the old man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life. </P>

    "This is the first time since I have been here," said he, "that any one has entered here. Who are you, sir?" </P>

    The Bishop answered:-- </P>

    "My name is Bienvenu Myriel." </P>

    "Bienvenu Myriel? I have heard that name. Are you the man whom the people call Monseigneur Welcome?" </P>

    "I am." The old man resumed with a half-smile. "In that case, you are my bishop?" </P>

    "Something of that sort." "Enter, sir." </P>

    The member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the Bishop did not take it. The Bishop confined himself to the remark:-- </P>

    "I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed. You certainly do not seem to me to be ill." </P>

    "Monsieur," replied the old man, "I am going to recover." </P>

    He paused, and then said:-- </P>

    "I shall die three hours hence." </P>

    Then he continued:-- </P>

    "I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws on. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, I shall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it does not fatigue me. You have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment. One has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours. It will be night then. What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that. So be it. I shall die by starlight." </P>

    The old man turned to the shepherd lad:-- </P>

    "Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired." </P>

    The child entered the hut. </P>

    The old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:-- </P>

    "I shall die while he sleeps. The two slumbers may be good neighbors." </P>

    The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at "His Grace," was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort "citizen." He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe. </P>

    Meanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust. </P>

    The Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity. G----, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistaken the door. G---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so. There was freedom in his agony. His legs alone were motionless. It was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light. G----, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who was flesh above and marble below. </P>

    There was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium was abrupt. </P>

    "I congratulate you," said he, in the tone which one uses for a reprimand. "You did not vote for the death of the king, after all." </P>

    The old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words "after all." He replied. The smile had quite disappeared from his face. </P>

    "Do not congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote for the death of the tyrant." </P>

    It was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity. </P>

    "What do you mean to say?" resumed the Bishop. </P>

    "I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance. I voted for the death of that tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority falsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man should be governed only by science." </P>

    "And conscience," added the Bishop. </P>

    "It is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us." </P>

    Monseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language, which was very new to him. </P>

    The member of the Convention resumed:-- </P>

    "So far as Louis XVI. was concerned, I said `no.' I did not think that I had the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil. I voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of prostitution for woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night for the child. In voting for the Republic, I voted for that. I voted for fraternity, concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors. The crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light. We have caused the fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase of miseries, has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn of joy." </P>

    "Mixed joy," said the Bishop. </P>

    "You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of the past, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas! The work was incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is not sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; the wind is still there." </P>

    "You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a demolition complicated with wrath." </P>

    "Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of progress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is the consecration of humanity." </P>

    The Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:-- </P>

    "Yes? '93!" </P>

    The member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation:-- </P>

    "Ah, there you go; '93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial." </P>

    The Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something within him had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good face on the matter. He replied:-- </P>

    "The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name of pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt should commit no error." And he added, regarding the member of the Convention steadily the while, "Louis XVII.?" </P>

    The conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop's arm. </P>

    "Louis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it for the innocent child? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royal child? I demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche, an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Greve, until death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother of Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an innocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime of having been grandson of Louis XV." </P>

    "Monsieur," said the Bishop, "I like not this conjunction of names." </P>

    "Cartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?" </P>

    A momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come, and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken. </P>

    The conventionary resumed:-- </P>

    "Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ loved them. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge, full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried, `Sinite parvulos,' he made no distinction between the little children. It would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is its own crown. Innocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys." </P>

    "That is true," said the Bishop in a low voice. </P>

    "I persist," continued the conventionary G---- "You have mentioned Louis XVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall we weep for all the innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted? I agree to that. But in that case, as I have told you, we must go back further than '93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII. I will weep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people." </P>

    "I weep for all," said the Bishop. </P>

    "Equally!" exclaimed conventionary G----; "and if the balance must incline, let it be on the side of the people. They have been suffering longer." </P>

    Another silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. He raised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony. It was almost an explosion. </P>

    "Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! that is not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me about Louis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been in these parts I have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside, and seeing no one but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me in a confused manner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must admit; but that signifies nothing: clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound of your carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork of the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you. You have told me that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to your moral personality. In short, I repeat my question. Who are you? You are a bishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,--the bishopric of D---- fifteen thousand francs settled income, ten thousand in perquisites; total, twenty-five thousand francs,-- who have kitchens, who have liveries, who make good cheer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, a lackey behind, in a gala coach, and who have palaces, and who roll in their carriages in the name of Jesus Christ who went barefoot! You are a prelate,--revenues, palace, horses, servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have this like the rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this says either too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me. To whom do I speak? Who are you?" </P>

    The Bishop hung his head and replied, "Vermis sum--I am a worm." </P>

    "A worm of the earth in a carriage?" growled the conventionary. </P>

    It was the conventionary's turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop's to be humble. </P>

    The Bishop resumed mildly:-- </P>

    "So be it, sir. But explain to me how my carriage, which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which I eat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that '93 was not inexorable. </P>

    The conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweep away a cloud. </P>

    "Before replying to you," he said, "I beseech you to pardon me. I have just committed a wrong, sir. You are at my house, you are my guest, I owe you courtesy. You discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments. Your riches and your pleasures are advantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates that I shall not make use of them. I promise you to make no use of them in the future." </P>

    "I thank you," said the Bishop. </P>

    G---- resumed. </P>

    "Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where were we? What were you saying to me? That '93 was inexorable?" "Inexorable; yes," said the Bishop. "What think you of Marat clapping his hands at the guillotine?" </P>

    "What think you of Bossuet chanting the Te Deum over the dragonnades?" The retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply occurred to him; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to Bossuet. The best of minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic. </P>

    The conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes. He went on:-- "Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing. Apart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human affirmation, '93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir; but what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name do you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is your opinion as to Lamoignon-Baville? Maillard is terrible; but Saulx-Tavannes, if you please? Duchene senior is ferocious; but what epithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tete is a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir, sir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am also sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist, to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld that breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the woman, a mother and a nurse, `Abjure!' giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience. What say you to that torture of Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in mind sir: the French Revolution had its reasons for existence; its wrath will be absolved by the future; its result is the world made better. From its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race. I abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover, I am dying." </P>

    And ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words:-- </P>

    "Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they are over, this fact is recognized,--that the human race has been treated harshly, but that it has progressed." </P>

    The conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, and from this intrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu's resistance, came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning:-- </P>

    "Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor. He who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race." </P>

    The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized with a fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a tear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down his livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:-- </P>

    "O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!" </P>

    The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock. </P>

    After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:-- </P>

    "The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person would be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it would not exist. There is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite is God." </P>

    The dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with the shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken, his eyes closed. The effort had exhausted him. It was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him. That which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death. The supreme moment was approaching. </P>

    The Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he had come: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion; he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and ice-cold hand in his, and bent over the dying man. </P>

    "This hour is the hour of God. Do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?" </P>

    The conventionary opened his eyes again. A gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance. </P>

    "Bishop," said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, "I have passed my life in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed, I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed and confessed them. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France was menaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor. I have been one of the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls, which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I have succored the oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth from the altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country. I have always upheld the march forward of the human race, forward towards the light, and I have sometimes resisted progress without pity. I have, when the occasion offered, protected my own adversaries, men of your profession. And there is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spot where the Merovingian kings had their summer palace, a convent of Urbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in 1793. I have done my duty according to my powers, and all the good that I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted, blackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many years past, I with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present the visage of one damned. And I accept this isolation of hatred, without hating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six years old; I am on the point of death. What is it that you have come to ask of me?" </P>

    "Your blessing," said the Bishop. </P>

    And he knelt down. </P>

    When the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary had become august. He had just expired. </P>

    The Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. On the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the Convention G----; he contented himself with pointing heavenward. </P>

    From that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers. </P>

    Any allusion to "that old wretch of a G----" caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage of that soul before his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did not count for something in his approach to perfection. </P>

    This "pastoral visit" naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries. </P>

    "Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those revolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to be seen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil." </P>

    One day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual, addressed this sally to him, "Monseigneur, people are inquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!"--"Oh! oh! that's a coarse color," replied the Bishop. "It is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat."</P>

    我们在前面几页提过一封信，在那信上所载日期过后不久的一个时期里，他又做了一件事，这一件事，在全城的人的心目中，是比上次他在那强人出没的山中旅行，更加来得冒失。</P>

    在迪涅附近的一个乡村里住着一个与世隔绝的人。那人曾经当过……让我们立即说出他那不中听的名称：国民公会①代表。他姓G．。 </P>

    ①国民公会成立于一七九二年九月二十一日，是由人民大众选举产生的。会议宣布法兰西共和国的成立，判处国王路易十六和王后玛丽·安东尼特死刑。</P>

    在迪涅那种小天地里，大家一谈到国民公会的那位G．代表，便有谈虎色变之感。一个国民公会代表，那还了得！那种东西是大家在以“你”和“公民”①相称的年代里存在过的。那个人就差不多是魔怪。他虽然没有投票判处国王死刑，但是已相去不远。那是个类似弑君的人。他是横暴骇人的。正统的王爷们回国②后，怎么会没有人把他告到特别法庭里去呢？不砍掉他的脑袋，也未尝不可，我们应当宽大，对的；但是好好地来他一个终身放逐，总是应当的吧？真是怪事！诸如此类的话。他并且和那些人一样，是个无神论者棗这些全是鹅群诋毁雄鹰的妄谈。 </P>

    ①革命期间，人民语言中称“你”不称“您”。称“某某公民”而不称“某某先生”。</P>

    ②一八一四年，拿破仑帝国被颠覆，王室复辟，路易十六之弟路易十八回国称王。</P>

    G．究竟是不是雄鹰呢？如果我们从他那孤独生活中所特有的蛮性上着眼，他确是。由于他没有投票赞成处决国王，所以屡次的放逐令上都没有他的名字，他也就能留在法国。</P>

    他的住处离城有三刻钟的路程，远离一切村落，远离一切道路，不知是在哪个荒山野谷、人迹不到的角落里。据说他在那里有一块地、一个土洞，一个窝巢。没有邻居，甚至没有过路的人。那条通到他那里去的小路，自从他住在那山谷里以后，也就消失在荒草中了。大家提起他那住处，就好象谈到刽子手的家。</P>

    可是主教不能忘怀，他不时朝着这位老代表的住处，有一丛树木标志着的山谷，远远望去，他还说：“那儿有个孤独的灵魂。”</P>

    在他思想深处，他还要说：“我迟早得去看他一遭。”</P>

    但是，老实说，那个念头在起初虽然显得自然，经过一番思考之后，他却又好象觉得它奇怪，觉得这是做不到的，几乎是不能容忍的。因为实际上他也具有一般人的看法，那位国民公会代表使他莫名其妙地产生一种近似仇恨的恶感，也就是“格格不入”这四个字最能表达的那种恶感。</P>

    可是羔羊的癣疥应当使牧人却步吗？不应当。况且那又是怎样的一头羔羊！</P>

    那位慈祥的主教为之犹豫不决。有时，他朝那方向走去，随即又转回来。</P>

    一天，有个在那窑洞里伺候那位G．代表的少年牧人来到城里找医生，说那老贼已经病到垂危，他得了瘫痪症，过不了夜。这话在城里传开了，许多人说：“谢天谢地。”</P>

    主教立即拿起他的拐杖，披上他的外衣（因为，正如我们说过的，他的道袍太旧了，也因为将有晚风），一径走了。</P>

    当他走到那无人齿及的地方，太阳正往西沉，几乎到了地平线。他的心怦怦跳动，他知道距那兽穴已经不远。他跨过一条沟，越过一道篱，打开栅门，走进一个荒芜的菜圃，相当大胆地赶上几步，到了那荒地的尽头，一大丛荆棘的后面，他发现了那窝巢。</P>

    那是一所极其低陋狭窄而整洁的木屋，前面墙上钉着一列葡萄架。</P>

    门前，一个白发老人坐在一张有小轮子的旧椅子（农民的围椅）里，对着太阳微笑。</P>

    在那坐着的老人身旁，立着个少年，就是那牧童。他正递一罐牛奶给那老人。</P>

    主教正张望，那老人提高嗓子说：</P>

    “谢谢，我不再需要什么了。”</P>

    同时，他把笑脸从太阳移向那孩子。</P>

    主教往前走。那坐着的老人，听见他的脚步声转过头来，如闻空谷足音，脸上露出极端惊讶的颜色。</P>

    “自从我住到这里以来，”他说，“这还是第一次有人上我的门。先生，您是谁？”</P>

    主教回答：</P>

    “我叫卞福汝·米里哀。”</P>

    “卞福汝·米里哀！我听人说过这名字。老乡们称为卞福汝主教的，难道就是您吗？”</P>

    “就是我。”</P>

    那老人面露微笑，接着说：</P>

    “那么，您是我的主教了？”</P>

    “有点儿象。”</P>

    “请进，先生。”</P>

    那位国民公会代表把手伸给主教，但是主教没有和他握手，只说道：</P>

    “我很高兴上了人家的当。看您的样子，您一点也没有病。”</P>

    “先生，”那老人回答，“我会好的。”</P>

    他停了一会，又说：</P>

    “我过不了三个钟头，就要死了。”</P>

    随后他又说：</P>

    “我稍稍懂一点医道，我知道临终的情形是怎样的。昨天我还只是脚冷；今天，冷到膝头了；现在我觉得冷齐了腰，等到冷到心头，我就停摆了。夕阳无限好，不是吗？我叫人把我推到外面来，为的是要对这一切景物，作最后一次展望。您可以和我谈话，一点也不会累我的。您赶来看一个快死的人，这是好的。这种时刻，能有一两个人在场，确是难得。妄想人人都有，我希望能拖到黎明。但是我知道，我只有不到三个钟头的时间了。到那时，天已经黑了。其实，有什么关系！死是一件简单的事。并不一定要在早晨。就这样吧。我将披星戴月而去。”</P>

    老人转向那牧童说：</P>

    “你，你去睡吧。你昨晚已经守了一夜。你累了。”</P>

    那孩子回到木屋里去了。</P>

    老人用眼睛送着他，仿佛对自己说：</P>

    “他入睡，我长眠。同是梦中人，正好相依相伴。”</P>

    主教似乎会受到感动，其实不然。他不认为这样死去的人可以悟到上帝。让我们彻底谈清楚，因为宽大的胸怀中所含的细微的矛盾也一样是应当指出来的。平时，遇到这种事，如果有人称他为“主教大人”，他认为不值一笑，可是现在没有人称他为“我的主教”，却又觉得有些唐突，并且几乎想反过来称这位老人为“公民”了。他在反感中突然起了一种想对人亲切的心情，那种心情在医生和神甫中是常见的，在他说来却是绝无仅有的。无论如何，这个人，这个国民公会代表，这位人民喉舌，总当过一时的人中怪杰，主教觉得自己的心情忽然严峻起来，这在他一生中也许还是第一次。</P>

    那位国民公会代表却用一种谦虚诚挚的态度觑着他，从这里我们可以看出其中含有那种行将物化的人的卑怯神情。</P>

    在主教方面，他平素虽然约束自己，不起窥测旁人隐情的心思，因为在他看来，蓄意窥测旁人隐情，即类似对人存心侵犯，可是对这位国民公会代表，却不能不细心研究；这种不是由同情心出发的动机，如果去对待另一个人，他也许会受到自己良心的责备。但是一个国民公会代表，在他的思想上多少有些法外人的意味，甚至连慈悲的法律也是不予保护的。G．，这位八十岁的魁梧老叟，态度镇定，躯干几乎挺直，声音宏亮，足以使生理学家惊叹折服。革命时期有过许多那样的人，都和那时代相称。从这个老人身上，我们可以想见那种经历过千锤百炼的人。离死已经那样近了，他还完全保有健康的状态。他那明炯的目光、坚定的语气、两肩强健的动作，都足以使死神望而生畏。伊斯兰教中的接引天使阿兹拉伊尔①也会望而却步，以为走错了门呢。G．的样子好象即将死去，那只是因为他自己愿意那样的缘故罢了。他在临终时却仍能自主，只是两条腿僵了，他只是在那一部分被幽魂扼制住了。两只脚死了，也冷了，头脑却还活着，还保持着生命的全部活力，并且似乎还处在精神焕发的时期。G．在这一严重的时刻，正和东方神话中的那个国王相似，上半是肉身，下半是石体。 </P>

    ①阿兹拉伊尔（AzeBral），伊斯兰教四大天使之一，专司死亡事宜，人死时由其取命。</P>

    他旁边有块石头。主教便在那上面坐下。他们突然开始对话。</P>

    “我祝贺您，”他用谴责的语气说，“您总算没有投票赞成判处国王死刑。”</P>

    国民公会代表好象没有注意到“总算”那两个字所含的尖刻意味。他开始回答，脸上的笑容全消灭了：</P>

    “不要祝贺得太甚了，先生。我曾投票表决过暴君的末日。”</P>

    那种刚强的语气是针对着严肃的口吻而发的。</P>

    “您这话怎讲？”</P>

    “我的意思是说，人类有一个暴君，那就是蒙昧。我表决了这个暴君的末日。王权就是从那暴君产生的，王权是一种伪造的权力，只有知识才是真正的权力。人类只应受知识的统治。”</P>

    “那么，良心呢？”主教接着说。</P>

    “那是同一回事。良心，是存在于我们心中与生俱有的那么一点知识。”</P>

    那种论调对卞福汝主教是非常新奇的，他听了，不免有些诧异。</P>

    国民公会代表继续说：</P>

    “关于路易十六的事，我没有赞同。我不认为我有处死一个人的权利；但是我觉得我有消灭那种恶势力的义务。我表决了那暴君的末日，这就是说，替妇女消除了卖身制度，替男子消除了奴役制度，替幼童消除了不幸生活。我在投票赞成共和制度时也就赞助了那一切。我赞助了博爱、协和、曙光！我出力打破了邪说和谬见。邪说和谬见的崩溃造成了光明。我们这些人推翻了旧世界，旧世界就好象一个苦难的瓶，一旦翻倒在人类的头上，就成了一把欢乐的壶。”</P>

    “光怪陆离的欢乐。”主教说。</P>

    “您不妨说多灾多难的欢乐，如今，目从那次倒霉的所谓一八一四年的倒退以后，也就可以说是昙花一现的欢乐了。可惜！那次的事业是不全面的，我承认；我们在实际事物中摧毁了旧的制度，在思想领域中却没能把它完全铲除掉。消灭恶习是不够的，还必须转移风气。风车已经不存在了，风却还存在。”</P>

    “您做了摧毁工作。摧毁可能是有好处的。可是对夹有怒气的摧毁行为，我就不敢恭维。”</P>

    “正义是有愤怒的，主教先生，并且正义的愤怒是一种进步的因素。没关系，无论世人怎样说，法兰西革命是自从基督出世以来人类向前走得最得力的一步。不全面，当然是的，但是多么卓绝。它揭穿了社会上的一切黑幕。它涤荡了人们的习气，它起了安定、镇静、开化的作用，它曾使文化的洪流广被世界。它是仁慈的。法兰西革命是人类无上的光荣。”</P>

    主教不禁嗫嚅：</P>

    “是吗？九三①！” </P>

    ①一七九三年的简称，那是革命进入高潮、处死国王路易十六的一年。</P>

    国民公会代表直从他的椅子上竖立起来，容貌严峻，几乎是悲壮的，尽他瞑目以前的周身气力，大声喊着说：</P>

    “呀！对！九三！这个字我等了许久了。满天乌云密布了一千五百年。过了十五个世纪之后，乌云散了，而您却要加罪于雷霆。”</P>

    那位主教，嘴里虽未必肯承认，却感到心里有什么东西被他击中了。不过他仍然不动声色。他回答：</P>

    “法官说话为法律，神甫说话为慈悲，慈悲也不过是一种比较高级的法律而已。雷霆的一击总不应搞错目标吧。”</P>

    他又聚精会神觑着那国民公会代表，加上一句：</P>

    “路易十七①呢？”</P>

    国民公会代表伸出手来，把住主教的胳膊：</P>

    “路易十七！哈。您在替谁流泪？替那无辜的孩子吗？那么，好吧。我愿和您同声一哭。替那年幼的王子吗？我却还得考虑考虑。在我看来，路易十五的孙子②是个无辜的孩子，他唯一的罪名是做了路易十五的孙子，以致殉难于大庙；卡图什③的兄弟也是一个无辜的孩子，他唯一的罪名是做了卡图什的兄弟，以致被人捆住胸脯，吊在格雷沃广场，直到气绝，那孩子难道就死得不惨？” </P>

    ①路易十七是路易十六的儿子，十岁上（1795）死在狱中。</P>

    ②指路易十七。</P>

    ③卡图什（Cartouche，1693?721），人民武装起义领袖，一七二一年被捕，被处死刑。</P>

    “先生，”主教说，“我不喜欢把这两个名字联在一起。”</P>

    “卡图什吗？路易十五吗？您究竟替这两个中的哪一个叫屈呢？”</P>

    一时相对无言。主教几乎后悔多此一行，但是他觉得自己隐隐地、异样地被他动摇了。</P>

    国民公会代表又说：</P>

    “咳！主教先生，您不爱真理的辛辣味儿。从前基督却不象您这样。他拿条拐杖，清除了圣殿。他那条电光四射的鞭子简直是真理的一个无所顾忌的代言人。当他喊道‘让小孩子到我这里来！’①时，他对于那些孩子，并没有厚此薄彼的意思。他对巴拉巴②的长子和希律③的储君能同眼看待而无动于衷。先生，天真本身就是王冕。天真不必有所作为也一样是高尚的。它无论是穿着破衣烂衫或贵为公子王孙，总是同样尊贵的。” </P>

    ①“让小孩子到我这里来”，这是耶稣对那些不许孩子听道的门徒说的话。原文是拉丁文Siniteparvulos（见《圣经·马太福音》第十九章）</P>

    ②巴拉巴（Barabbas），和耶稣同时判罪的罪犯。</P>

    ③希律（Hérode），纪元前犹太国王。</P>

    “那是真话。”主教轻轻地说。</P>

    “我要坚持下去，”国民公会代表G．继续说，“您对我提到过路易十七。让我们在这上面取得一致的看法。我们是不是为一切在上层和在下层的无辜受害者、殉难者、孩子们同声一哭呢？我会和您一道哭的。不过，我已对您说过，我们必须追溯到九三年以前。我们的眼泪应当从九三年以前流起。我一定和您同哭王室的孩子，如果您也和我同哭平民的幼童。”</P>

    “我为他们全体哭。”主教说。</P>

    “同等分量吗？”G．大声说，“这天平如果倾斜，也还应当偏向平民一面吧。平民受苦的年代比较长些。”</P>

    又是一阵沉寂。突破沉寂的仍是那国民公会代表。他抬起身子，倚在一只肘上，用他的拇指和曲着的食指捏着一点腮，正如我们在盘问和审讯时无意中作出的那种样子，他向主教提出质问，目光中充满了临终时的全部气力。那几乎是一阵爆炸。</P>

    “是呀，先生，平民受苦的日子够长了。不但如此，您走来找我，问这问那，和我谈到路易十七，目的何在？我并不认识您呀。自从我住在这地方，孤零零的我在这围墙里过活，两只脚从不出门，除了那个帮我的小厮以外谁也不见面。的确，我的耳朵也偶尔刮到过您的名字，我还应当说，您的名气并不太坏，但是那并不说明什么问题，聪明人自有层出不穷的办法来欺哄一个忠厚老实的平民。说也奇怪，我刚才没有听到您车子的声音，也许您把它留在岔路口那面的树丛后面了吧。我并不认识您，您听见了吧。您刚才说您是主教，但是这话一点也不能对我说明您的人格究竟怎样。我只得重复我的问题。您是谁？您是一个主教，那就是说一个教门里的王爷，那些装了金，穿着铠甲，吃利息，坐享大宗教款的人中的一个——迪涅的主教，一万五千法郎的正式年俸，一万法郎的特别费，合计二万五千法郎——，有厨子，有随从，有佳肴美酒，星期五吃火鸡，仆役在前，仆役在后，高视阔步，坐华贵的轿式马车，住的是高楼大厦，捧着跣足徒步的耶稣基督做幌子，高车驷马，招摇过市，主教便是这一类人中的一个。您是一位高级教主，年俸、宫室、骏马、侍从、筵席、人生的享乐，应有尽有，您和那些人一样，也有这些东西，您也和他们一样，享乐受用，很好，不过事情已够明显了，但也可能还不够明显；您来到此地，也许发了宏愿，想用圣教来开导我，但是您并没有教我认清您自身的真正品质。我究竟是在和什么人谈话？您是谁？”</P>

    主教低下头，回答：“我是一条蛆。”①</P>

    “好一条坐轿车的蛆！”国民公会代表咬着牙说。</P>

    这一下，轮到国民公会代表逞强，主教低声下气了。</P>

    主教和颜悦色，接着说：</P>

    “先生，就算是吧。但是请您替我解释解释：我那辆停在树丛后面不远的轿车，我的筵席和我在星期五吃的火鸡，我的二万五千法郎的年俸，我的宫室和我的侍从，那些东西究竟怎样才能证明慈悲不是一种美德，宽厚不是一种为人应尽之道，九三年不是伤天害理的呢？”</P>

    国民公会代表把一只手举上额头，好象要拨开一阵云雾。</P>

    “在回答您的话以前，”他说，“我要请您原谅。我刚才失礼了，先生。您是在我家里，您是我的客人。我应当以礼相待。您讨论到我的思想，我只应当批判您的论点就可以了。您的富贵和您的享乐，在辩论当中，我固然可以用来作为反击您的利器，但究竟有伤忠厚，不如不用。我一定不再提那些事了。”</P>

    “我对您很感谢。”主教说。</P>

    G．接着说：</P>

    “让我们回到您刚才向我要求解释的方面去吧。我们刚才谈到什么地方了？您刚才说的是……您说九三年伤天害理吗？”</P>

    “伤天害理，是的，”主教说，“您对马拉②朝着断头台鼓掌有怎样一种看法？” </P>

    ①这一句原文为拉丁文“Vermissum”。</P>

    ②马拉（Marat，1743?793），法国政论家，雅各宾派领袖之一，罗伯斯庇尔的忠实战友，群众称他为“人民之友”。</P>

    “您对博须埃①在残害新教徒时高唱圣诗，又是怎样想的呢？”</P>

    那种回答是坚劲的，直指目标，锐如利剑。主教为之一惊，他绝想不出一句回驳的话，但是那样提到博须埃，使他感到大不痛快。极高明的人也有他们的偶像，有时还会由于别人不尊重逻辑而隐痛在心。</P>

    国民公会代表开始喘气了，他本来已经气力不济，加以临终时呼吸阻塞，说话的声音便成了若断若续的了，可是他的眼睛表现出他的神志还是完全清醒的。</P>

    他继续说：</P>

    “让我们再胡乱谈几句，我很乐意。那次的革命，总的说来，是获得了人类的广泛赞扬的，只可惜九三年成了一种口实。您认为那是伤天害理的一年，但就整个专制政体来说呢，先生？卡里埃②是个匪徒；但是您又怎样称呼蒙特维尔③呢？富基埃－泰维尔④是个无赖；但是您对拉莫瓦尼翁－巴维尔⑤有什么见解呢？马亚尔⑥罪大恶极，但请问索尔－达瓦纳⑦呢，杜善伯伯⑧横蛮凶狠，但对勒泰利埃神甫⑨，您又加上怎样的评语呢？茹尔丹屠夫⑩是个魔怪，但是还比不上卢夫瓦⑾侯爷。先生呀，先生，我为大公主和王后玛丽·安东尼特叫屈，但是我也为那个信仰新教的穷妇人叫屈，那穷妇人在一六八五年大路易当国的时候，先生呀，正在给她孩子喂奶，却被人家捆在一个木桩上，上身一丝不挂，孩子被放在一旁；她乳中充满乳汁，心中充满怆痛；那孩子，饥饿不堪，脸色惨白，瞧着母亲的乳，有气无力地哭个不停；刽子手却对那做母亲和乳娘的妇人说：‘改邪归正！’要她在她孩子的死亡和她信心的死亡中任择一种。教一个做母亲的人受那种眼睁睁的生离死别的苦痛，您觉得有什么可说的吗？先生，请记住这一点，法国革命自有它的理论根据。它的愤怒在未来的岁月中会被人谅解的。它的成果便是一个改进了的世界。从它的极猛烈的鞭挞中产生出一种对人类的爱抚。我得少说话，我不再开口了，我的理由太充足。况且我快断气了。” </P>

    ①博须埃（Bossuet，1627?704），法国天主教的护卫者，是最有声望的主教之一。</P>

    ②卡里埃（Carrier，1756?794），国民公会代表，一七九四年上断头台。</P>

    ③蒙特维尔（Montrevel），十七世纪末法国朗格多克地区新教徒的迫害者。</P>

    ④富基埃－泰维尔（ForguierCTinville），法国十八世纪末革命法庭的起诉人，恐怖时期尤为有名，后被处死。</P>

    ⑤拉莫瓦尼翁－巴维尔（LamoignonCBaville，1648?724），法国朗格多克地区总督，一六八五年无情镇压新教徒。</P>

    ⑥马亚尔（StanislasMaillard），以执行一七九二年九月的大屠杀而闻名于世。</P>

    ⑦索尔－达瓦纳（SaulxCTavannes），达瓦纳的贵族，一五七二年巴托罗缪屠杀案的唆使者之一。</P>

    ⑧杜善伯伯（lepèreDuchène），原是笑剧中一个普通人的形象，后来成了平民的通称。</P>

    ⑨勒泰利埃神甫（lepèreLetellier，1643?719），耶稣会教士，路易十四的忏悔神甫，曾使路易十四毁坏王家港。</P>

    ⑩马蒂厄·儒弗（MathieuJouve，1749?794），一七九一年法国阿维尼翁大屠杀的组织者，后获得屠夫茹尔丹的称号。</P>

    ⑾卢夫瓦（Louvois，1641?691），路易十四的军事大臣，曾劫掠巴拉丁那（今西德法尔茨）。</P>

    随后这位国民公会代表的眼睛不再望着主教，他只用这样的几句话来结束他的思想：</P>

    “是呀，进步的暴力便叫做革命。暴力过去以后，人们就认识到这一点：人类受到了呵斥，但是前进了。</P>

    国民公会代表未尝不知道他刚才已把主教心中的壁垒接二连三地夺过来了，可是还留下一处，那一处是卞福汝主教防卫力量的最后源泉，卞福汝主教说了这样一句话，几乎把舌战开始时的激烈态度又全流露出来了：</P>

    “进步应当信仰上帝。善不能由背弃宗教的人来体现，无神论者是人类的恶劣的带路人。”</P>

    那个年迈的人民代表没有回答。他发了一阵抖，望着天，眼睛里慢慢泌出一眶眼泪，眶满以后，那眼泪便沿着他青灰的面颊流了下来，他低微地对自己说，几乎语不成声，目光迷失在穹苍里：</P>

    “呵你！呵理想的境界！惟有你是存在的！”</P>

    主教受到一种无可言喻的感动。</P>

    一阵沉寂过后，那老人翘起一个指头，指着天说：</P>

    “无极是存在的。它就在那里。如果无极之中没有我，我就是它的止境；它也不成其为无极了；换句话说，它就是不存在的了。因此它必然有一个我。无极中的这个我，便是上帝。”</P>

    那垂死的人说了最后几句话，声音爽朗，还带着灵魂离开肉体时那种至乐的颤动，好象他望见了一个什么人似的。语声歇了过后，他的眼睛也合上了。一时的兴奋已使他精力涸竭。他剩下的几个钟头，显然已在顷刻之中耗尽了。他刚才说的那几句话已使他接近了那位生死的主宰。最紧要的时刻到了。</P>

    主教懂得，时间紧迫，他原是以神甫身份来到此地的，他从极端的冷淡一步步地进入了极端的冲动，他望着那双闭了的眼睛，他抓住那只枯皱冰冷的手，弯下腰去向那临终的人说：</P>

    “这个时刻是上帝的时刻了。如果我们只这样白白地聚首一场，您不觉得遗憾吗？”</P>

    国民公会代表重又张开眼睛。眉宇间呈现出一种严肃而阴郁的神情。</P>

    “主教先生，”他说，说得很慢，那不单是由于气力不济，还多半由于他心灵的高傲，“我在深思力学和观察当中度过了这一生。我六十岁的时候祖国号召我去管理国家事务。我服从了。当时有许多积弊，我进行了斗争；有暴政，我消除了暴政；有人权和法则，我都公布了，也进行了宣传。国土被侵犯，我保卫了国土：法兰西受到威胁，我献出我的热血。我从前并不阔气，现在也没有钱。我曾是政府领导人之一，当时在国库的地窖里堆满了现金，墙头受不住金银的压力，随时可以坍塌，以致非用支柱撑住不可，我却在枯树街吃二十二个苏一顿的饭。我帮助了受压迫的人，医治了人们的痛苦。我撕毁了祭坛上的布毯，那是真的，不过是为了裹祖国的创伤。我始终维护人类走向光明的步伐，有时也反抗过那种无情的进步。有机会，我也保护过我自己的对手，就是说，你们这些人。在佛兰德的比特罕地方，正在墨洛温王朝①夏宫的旧址上，有一座乌尔班派的寺院，就是波里尔的圣克雷修道院，那是我在一七九三年救出来的。我尽过我力所能及的职责，我行过我所能行的善事。此后我却被人驱逐，搜捕，通缉，迫害，诬蔑，讥诮，侮辱，诅骂，剥夺了公民权。多年以来，我白发苍苍，只觉得有许多人自以为有权轻视我，那些愚昧可怜的群众认为我面目可憎。我并不恨人，却乐于避开别人的恨。现在，我八十六岁了，快死了。您还来问我什么呢？”</P>

    “我来为您祝福。”主教说。 </P>

    ①墨洛温（Mérovée），法国第一个王朝，从五世纪中叶到八世纪中叶。</P>

    他跪了下来。</P>

    等到主教抬起头来，那个国民公会代表已经神色森严，气绝了。</P>

    主教回到家中，深深沉浸在一种无可言喻的思绪里。他整整祈祷了一夜。第二天，几个胆大好奇的人，想方设法，要引他谈论那个G．代表，他却只指指天。从此，他对小孩和有痛苦的人倍加仁慈亲切。</P>

    任何言词，只要影射到“G．老贼”，他就必然会陷入一种异样不安的状态中。谁也不能说，那样一颗心在他自己的心前的昭示，那伟大的良心在他的意识上所起的反应，对他日趋完善的精神会毫无影响。</P>

    那次的“乡村访问”当然要替本地的那些小集团提供饶舌的机会：</P>

    “那种死人的病榻前也能成为主教涉足的地方吗？明明没有什么感化可以指望。那些革命党人全是屡背圣教的。那，又何必到那里去呢？那里有什么可看的呢？真是好奇，魔鬼接收灵魂，他也要去看看。”</P>

    一天，有个阔寡妇，也就是那些自作聪明的冒失鬼中的一个，问了他这样一句俏皮话：“我的主教，有人要打听，大人您在什么时候能得到一顶红帽子①。”</P>

    “呵！呵！多么高贵的颜色，”主教回答，“幸而鄙视红帽子的人也还崇拜红法冠呢。” </P>

    ①戴红帽子，即参加革命的意思。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 11 A Restriction

    We should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to conclude from this that Monseigneur Welcome was "a philosophical bishop," or a "patriotic cure." His meeting, which may almost be designated as his union, with conventionary G----, left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment, which rendered him still more gentle. That is all.</P>

    Although Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is, perhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude.</P>

    Let us, then, go back a few years.</P>

    Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the Emperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other bishops. The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy convened at Paris. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembled for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency of Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who attended it. But he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences. Bishopof a mountain diocese, living so very close to nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly. He very soon returned to D---- He was interrogated as to this speedy return, and he replied: "I embarrassed them. The outside air penetrated to them through me. I produced on them the effect of an open door."</P>

    On another occasion he said, "What would you have? Those gentlemen are princes. I am only a poor peasant bishop."</P>

    The fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it is said that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues: "What beautiful clocks! What beautiful carpets! What beautiful liveries! They must be a great trouble. I would not have all those superfluities, crying incessantly in my ears: `There are people who are hungry! There are people who are cold! There are poor people! There are poor people!'"</P>

    Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts. Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with representations and ceremonies. It seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is a contradiction. The priest must keepclose to the poor. Now, can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all these misfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one's own person a little of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair, nor blackened nails, nor a dropof sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face? The first proof of charity in the priest, in the bishopespecially, is poverty.</P>

    This is, no doubt, what the Bishopof D---- thought.</P>

    It must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the "ideas of the century" on certain delicate points. He took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence on questions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had been strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait, and since we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that he was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations. He refused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island of Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor in his diocese during the Hundred Days.</P>

    Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a general, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable frequency. He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the Emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape. His correspondence with the other brother, the ex-prefect, a fine, worthy man who lived in retirement at Paris, Rue Cassette, remained more affectionate.</P>

    Thus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hour of bitterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things. Certainly, such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions. Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we are not confounding what is called "political opinions" with the grand aspiration for progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, democratic, humane, which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect. Without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book, we will simply say this: It would have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been a Royalist, and if his glance had never been, for a single instant, turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible, above the fictions and the hatreds of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes of human things, the beaming of those three pure radiances, truth, justice, and charity.</P>

    While admitting that it was not for a political office that God created Monseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but perilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling. We only love the fray so long as there is danger, and in any case, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last. He who has not been a stubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. As for us, when Providence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812 commenced to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits which aroused indignation. And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in the presence of those marshals who betrayed; in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another, insulting after having deified; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol,-- it was a duty to turn aside the head. In 1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it, and, after making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of the Bishopof D----, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss.</P>

    With this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable, intelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is only another sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It must be admitted, that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity, he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are speaking here. The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor. He was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of the Legion of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle. This poor fellow occasionally let slipinconsiderate remarks, which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches. After the imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed himself in his regimentals, as he said, so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which Napoleon had given him; this made a hole, and he would not put anything in its place. "I will die," he said, "rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart!" He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII. "The gouty old creature in English gaiters!" he said; "let him take himself off to Prussia with that queue of his." He was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested, Prussia and England. He did it so often that he lost his place. There he was, turned out of the house, with his wife and children, and without bread. The Bishopsent for him, reproved him gently, and appointed him beadle in the cathedral.</P>

    In the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of holy deeds and gentle manners, filled the town of D---- with a sort of tender and filial reverence. Even his conduct towards Napoleon had been accepted and tacitly pardoned, as it were, by the people, the good and weakly flock who adored their emperor, but loved their bishop.</P>

    如果我们就凭以上所述作出结论，认为卞福汝主教是个“有哲学头脑的主教”或是个“爱国的神甫”，我们就很可能发生错误。他和那国民公会G．代表的邂逅棗几乎可以说是他们的结合，只不过给他留下了一种使他变得更加温良的惊叹的回忆。如是而已。</P>

    卞福汝主教虽然是个政治中人，我们或许也还应当在这里极简略地谈谈他对当代的国家大事所抱的态度，假定卞福汝主教也曾想过要采取一种态度的话。</P>

    我们不妨把几年前的一些事回顾一下。</P>

    米里哀先生升任主教不久，皇上便封了他为帝国的男爵，同时也封了好几个旁的主教。我们知道，教皇是在一八○九年七月五日至六日的夜晚被拘禁的，为了这件事，米里哀先生被拿破仑召到巴黎去参加法兰西和意大利的主教会议。那次会议是在圣母院举行的，一八一一年六月十五日，在红衣主教斐许主持下，召开了第一次会议。九十五个主教参加了会议，米里哀先生是其中之一。但是他只参加过一次大会和三四次特别会。他是一个山区的主教，平时过着僻陋贫困的生活，和自然环境接近惯了，他觉得他替那些达官贵人带来了一种改变会场气氛的见解。他匆匆忙忙地回到迪涅去了。有人问他为什么回去得那样匆促，他回答：</P>

    “他们见了我不顺眼。外面的空气老跟着我钻到他们那里去。我在他们的眼里好象是一扇带不上的门。”</P>

    另外一次，他还说：</P>

    “有什么办法？那些先生们全是王子王孙。而我呢，只是一个干瘪瘪的乡下主教。”</P>

    他确是惹人嫌，不时作怪。有一晚，他在一个最有地位的同道家里，说出了这样的话，也许是脱口而出的：</P>

    “这许多漂亮的挂钟！这许多漂亮的地毯！这许多漂亮的服装！这些东西好不麻烦！我真不愿意听这些累赘的东西时常在我的耳边喊‘许多人在挨饿呢！许多人在挨冻呢！穷人多着呢！穷人多着呢！’”</P>

    我们顺便谈谈，对华贵物品的仇恨也许是不聪明的，因为这种仇恨隐藏着对艺术的敌意。不过，就教会中人来说，除了表示身份和举行仪式而外，使用华贵物品是错误的。那些东西仿佛可以揭露那种并非真心真意解囊济困的作风。教士养尊处优，就是离经叛道。教士应当接近穷人。一个人既然日日夜夜和一切灾难、苦痛、贫困相接触，难道在他自己身上竟能不象在劳动中沾上一些尘土那样，一点也不带那种圣洁的清寒味吗？我们能想象一个人站在烈火旁而不感到热吗？我们能想象一个工人经常在溶炉旁工作，而能没有一根头发被烧掉，没有一个手指被熏黑，脸上没有一滴汗珠，也没有一点灰屑吗？教士，尤其是主教，他的仁慈的最起码的保证，便是清苦。</P>

    这一定就是迪涅主教先生的见解了。</P>

    我们还不应当认为他在某些棘手问题上肯迎合那种所谓的“时代的思潮”。他很少参加当时的神学争辩，对政教的纠纷问题，他也不表示意见；但是，如果有人向他紧紧追问，他就仿佛是偏向罗马派方面而并不属于法国派①。我们既然是在描写一个人，并且不愿有所隐讳，我们就必须补充说明他对那位气焰渐衰的拿破仑，可以说是冷若冰霜的。一八一三年②以后，他曾经参与，或鼓掌赞同过各种反抗活动。拿破仑从厄尔巴岛③回来时，他拒绝到路旁去欢迎他，在“百日帝政”④期间，也不曾替皇上布置公祭。除了他的妹子巴狄斯丁姑娘以外，他还有两个亲兄弟，一个当过将军，一个当过省长。他和他们通信，相当频繁。有个时期，他对第一个兄弟颇为冷淡，因为那个兄弟原来镇守普罗旺斯⑤。戛纳登陆时那位将军统率一千二百人去截击皇上，却又有意放他走过。另外那个兄弟，当过省长，为人忠厚自持，隐居在巴黎卡塞特街，他给这个兄弟的信就比较富于手足之情。 </P>

    ①从一六八二年起，法国天主教以国内教士代表会议为处理宗教事务的最高权力机关，不完全接受罗马教皇的命令，是为法国派（gallican），主张完全依附教皇的称罗马派（ultramontain）。直到一八七○年，法国天主教始完全依附于罗马教皇。</P>

    ②一八一三年，拿破仑政权已濒于危殆，英、俄等七国联军节节进逼，国内工商业发生危机，由于缺乏劳动力，又因增加税收，大量征兵，资产阶级开始离贰，人民纷纷逃避兵役，老贵族也乘机阴谋恢复旧王朝。③拿破仑在一八一四年四月六日被迫逊位后，即被送往厄尔巴岛。王朝复辟，执行反动政策，人民普遍不满。拿破仑乘机于一八一五年三月一日在南方港口茹安（在戛纳附近）登陆，重返巴黎。</P>

    ④拿破仑三月一日在茹安登陆，六月二十二日第二次逊位，那一时期叫“百日帝政”。</P>

    ⑤普罗旺斯（Provence），法国南部一省。</P>

    足见卞福汝主教也偶尔有过他的政见、他的苦闷、他的隐情。当年的爱憎的暗影也曾穿过他那颗温和宽厚、追求永恒事物的心。当然，象他那样的人最好是没有政治见解。请不要把我们的意思歪曲了，我们所说的“政治见解”并不是指那种对进步所抱的热望，也不是指我们今天构成各方面真诚团结的内在力量的那种卓越的爱国主义、民主主义和人道主义思想，彼此不可相混。我们不必深究那些只间接涉及本书内容的问题，我们只简单地说，假使卞福汝不是保王党，假使他的目光从来一刻也不曾离开过他那种宁静的景仰，并且能超然于人世的风云变幻之外，能在景仰中看清真理、公正、慈善等三道纯洁光辉的放射，那就更美满了。</P>

    我们尽管承认上帝之所以创造卞福汝主教，绝不是为了一种政治作用，也仍然可以了解和钦佩他为人权和自由所提出的抗议，也就是他对那位不可一世的拿破仑所抱的高傲的对立态度和公正而危险的抗拒行为。但是藐视一个失势的人究竟不如藐视一个得势的人那样足快人意。我们只爱具有危险的斗争，在任何情况下，只有最初参加斗争的战士才有最后歼灭敌人的权利。谁没有在全盛时期提出过顽强的抗议，等到垮台时，谁就不该有发言权。只有控诉过胜利的人才有权裁判失败。至于我们，在上天不佑、降以大祸时，我们只能听其自然。一八一二年开始解除我们的武装。一八一三年，那个素来默不作声的立法机构，在国难临头时居然勇气百倍，大放厥词，这样只能令人齿冷，何足鼓掌称快？一八一四年，元帅们出卖祖国，上院从一个污池进入另一污池，始则尊为神人，继乃横加侮渎，从来崇拜偶像，忽又中途变节，反唾其面，这些事理应引起我们的反感；一八一五年，最后的灾难步步进逼了，法兰西因大祸临头而危险了，滑铁卢好象也展开在拿破仑跟前隐约可辨了；那时，军士和人民对那个祚运已尽的人的壮烈欢呼绝没有什么令人发叹的，并且，先不论那个专制魔王是个怎样的人，当此千钧一发之际，这伟大的民族和这伟大的人杰间的紧密团结总是庄严动人的，象迪涅主教那样一个人的心，似乎不应当熟视无睹。</P>

    除此以外，无论对什么事，他从来总是正直、诚实、公平、聪明、谦虚、持重的，好行善事，关心别人，这也是一种品德。他是一个神甫，一个贤达之士，也是一个大丈夫。他的政治见解，我们刚才已经批评过了，我们也几乎还可以严厉地指责他，可是应当指出，他尽管抱有那种见解，和我们这些现在在此地谈话的人比较起来，也许还更加厚道，更加平易近人一些。市政府的那个门房，当初是皇上安插在那里的。他原是旧羽林军里的一名下级军官，奥斯特里茨①战役勋章的获得者，一个象鹰那样精悍的拿破仑信徒。那个倒霉鬼会时常于无意中吐出一些牢骚话，那是被当时法律认为“叛逆言论”的。自从勋章上的皇帝侧面像被取消以后，为了避免佩带他那十字勋章，他的衣着就从来不再“遵照规定”（照他的说法）。他亲自把皇上的御影从拿破仑给他的那个十字勋章上虔诚地摘下来，那样就留下了一个窟窿，他却绝不愿代以其他的饰物。他常说：“我宁死也不愿在我的胸前挂上三个癞虾蟆！”他故意大声挖苦路易十八②。他又常说：“扎英国绑腿的烂脚鬼！快带着他的辫子到普鲁士去吧！”他以能那样把他最恨的两件东西，普鲁士和英格兰，连缀在一句骂人的话里而感到得意。他骂得太起劲了，以致丢了差事。他带着妻子儿女，无衣无食，流浪街头。主教却把他招来，轻轻责备了几句，派他去充当天主堂里的持戟士。 </P>

    ①奥斯特里茨（Austerlitz），在捷克境内，一八○五年，拿破仑在此战胜奥俄联军。</P>

    ②路易十八是路易十六的兄弟，拿破仑失败后，他在英普联军护送下回到巴黎，恢复了波旁王室的统治。</P>

    米里哀先生在他的教区里是一个名副其实的神甫，是大众的朋友。</P>

    九年以来，由于他行为圣洁，作风和蔼，卞福汝主教使迪涅城里充满一种柔顺的推崇。连他对拿破仑的态度也被人民接受，默宥了，人民原是一群善良柔弱的牛羊，他们崇拜他们的皇上，也爱戴他们的主教。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 12 The Solitude of Monseigneur Welcome

    A bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbes, just as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is what that charming Saint Francois de Sales calls somewhere "les pretres blancs-becs," callow priests. Every career has its aspirants, who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it. There is no power which has not its dependents. There is no fortune which has not its court. The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Every metropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur's smile. To please a bishop is equivalent to getting one's foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is necessary to walk one's path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship.</P>

    Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church. These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well endowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt, but who know also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person, who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbes rather than priests, prelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them! Being persons of influence, they create a shower about them, upon the assiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates, chaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. As they advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also; it is a whole solar system on the march. Their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite. Their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little promotions. The larger the diocese of the patron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite. And then, there is Rome. A bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries you with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then monsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot. Every skull-cap may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king. Then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary! How many blushing choristers, how many youthful abbes bear on their heads Perrette's pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee that it is.</P>

    Monseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among the big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him. We have seen that he "did not take" in Paris. Not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man. Not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished and he was completed. The impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed. A saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in advancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.</P>

    Be it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its false resemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost the same profile as supremacy. Success, that Menaechmus of talent, has one dupe,--history. Juvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In our day, a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service, wears the livery of success, and performs the service of its antechamber. Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. Win in the lottery, and behold! you are a clever man. He who triumphs is venerated. Be born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that. Be lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think you great. Outside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose the splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gilding is gold. It does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive. The common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd. That enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by acclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may consist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy: let a false Corneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances,--and men call that Genius, just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty, and the mien of Claude Majesty. With the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.</P>

    在将军的周围，常有成群的青年军官，在主教的周围，几乎也常有成批的小教士。这种人正是可爱的圣方济各·撒肋①在某处所说的那些“白口教士”。任何事业都有追求的人，追随着此中的成功者。世间没有一种无喽罗的势力，也没有一种无臣仆的尊荣。指望前程远大的人都围绕着目前的显贵奔走钻营。每个主教衙门都有它的幕僚。每个稍有势力的主教都有他那群天使般的小修士在主教院里巡逻，照顾，守卫，以图博取主教大人的欢心。获得主教的赏识，也就等于福星高照，有充当五品修士的希望了。求上进是人情之常，上帝的宗徒是不会亏待他的下属的。 </P>

    ①方济各·撒肋（FrancoisdeSales，1567?622），日内瓦主教，能文，重振天主教势力。</P>

    在别处有高大的帽子，教堂里也同样有嵬峨的法冠。这种人也就是那些主教，他们有势，有钱，坐收年息，手腕灵活，受到上层社会宠信，善于求人，当然也善于使人，他们指使整个主教区的教民亲自登门拜谒，他们充当教会与外交界之间的桥梁，他们足为教士而不足为神甫，足为教廷执事而不足为主教。接近他们的人都皆大欢喜！那些地位优越的人，他们把肥的教区、在家修行人的赡养费、教区督察官职位、随军教士职位、天主堂里的差事，雨一般的撒在他们周围的那些殷勤献媚，博得他们欢心，长于讨好他们的青年们的头上，以待将来再加上主教的尊贵。他们自己高升，同时也带着卫星前进；那是在行进中的整个太阳系。他们的光辉把追随着他们的人都照得发紫。他们一人得志，众人都荫余福高升。老板的教区越广，宠幸的地盘也越大，并且还有罗马在。由主教而总主教而红衣主教的人可以提拔你为红衣主教的随员，你进入宗教裁判所，你会得到绣黑十字的白呢飘带，你就做起陪审官来了，再进而为内廷机要秘书，再进而为主教，并且只须再走一步就由主教升为红衣主教了，红衣主教与教皇之间也不过只有一番选举的虚文。凡是头戴教士小帽的人都可以梦想教皇的三重冕。神甫是今天唯一能按部就班升上王位的人，并且那是何等的王位！至高无上的王位。同时，教士培养所又是怎样一种培植野心的温床！多少腼腆的唱诗童子，多少年轻的教士都顶上了贝莱特①的奶罐！包藏野心的人自吹能虔诚奉教，自以为那是轻而易举的事，也许他确有那样一片诚心，谁知道？沉迷久了，自己也就有些莫名其妙。 </P>

    ①拉封丹（LaFontaine）的寓言谈到一个送奶的姑娘，叫贝莱特，她头上顶一罐奶进城，一路梦想把奶卖了，可以买一百个鸡蛋，孵出小鸡养大，卖了买猪，猪卖了又买牛，牛生了小牛，她看见小牛在草地上跳，乐到自己也跳起来，把奶罐翻在地上，结果是一场空。</P>

    卞福汝主教谦卑、清寒、淡泊，没有被人列入那些高贵的主教里面。那可以从在他左右完全没有青年教士这一点上看出来。我们已经知道，他在巴黎“毫无成就”。没有一个后生愿把自己的前程托付给那样一个孤独老人。没有一株有野心的嫩苗起过想在他的庇荫了发绿的傻念头。他的那些教士和助理主教全是一些安分守己的老头儿，和他一样的一些老百姓，和他一同株守在那个没有福气产生红衣主教的教区里，他们就象他们的那位主教，不同的地方只是：他们是完了事的，而他是成了事的。大家都觉得在卞福汝主教跟前没有发迹的可能，以致那些刚从教士培养所里出来的青年人，经他任为神甫之后，便都转向艾克斯总主教或欧什总主教那里去活动，赶忙离开了他。因为，我们再说一次，凡人都愿意有人提拔。一个过于克己的圣人便是一个可以误事的伙伴，他可以连累你陷入一条无可救药的绝路，害你关节僵硬，行动不得，总之，他会要你躬行实践你不愿接受的那种谦让之道。因此大家都逃避那种癞疥似的德行。这也就是卞福汝主教门庭冷落的原因。我们生活在阴暗的社会里，向上爬，正是一种由上而下的慢性腐蚀教育。</P>

    顺便谈一句，成功是一件相当丑恶的事。它貌似真才实学，而实际是以伪乱真。一般人常以为成功和优越性几乎是同一回事。成功是才能的假相，受它愚弄的是历史。只有尤维纳利斯①和塔西佗②在这方面表示过愤慨。在我们这时代有种几乎被人公认为哲学正宗的理论，它成了成功的仆从，它标榜成功，并不惜为成功操贱役。你设法成功吧，这就是原理。富贵就等于才能。中得头彩，你便是一个出色的人才。谁得势，谁就受人尊崇。只要你的八字好，一切都大有可为。只要你有好运气，其余的东西也就全在你的掌握中了。只要你能事事如意，大家便认为你伟大。除了五六个震动整个世纪的突出的例外以外，我们这时代的推崇全是近视的。金漆就是真金。阿猫阿狗，全无关系，关键只在成功。世间俗物，就象那顾影自怜的老水仙③一样，很能赞赏俗物。任何人在任何方面，只要达到目的，众人便齐声喝彩，夸为奇才异能，说他比得上摩西、埃斯库罗斯④、但丁、米开朗琪罗或拿破仑。无论是一个书吏当了议员，一个假高乃依⑤写了一本《第利达特》⑥，一个太监乱了宫闱，一个披着军服的纸老虎侥幸地打了一次划时代的胜仗，一个药剂师发明了纸鞋底冒充皮革，供给桑布尔和默兹军区而获得四十万利弗的年息，一个百货贩子盘剥厚利，攒聚了七八百万不义之财，一个宣道士因说话带浓重鼻音而当上了主教，一个望族的管家在告退时成了巨富，因而被擢用为财政大臣，凡此种种，人们都称为天才，正如他们以穆司克东⑦的嘴脸为美，以克劳狄乌斯⑧的派头为仪表一样。他们把穹苍中的星光和鸭掌在烂泥里踏出的迹印混为一谈。 </P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 13 What he believed

    We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score of orthodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect. The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word. Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own. </P>

    What did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery? These secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where souls enter naked. The point on which we are certain is, that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case. No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of his powers. "Credo in Patrem," he often exclaimed. Moreover, he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience, and which whispers to a man, "Thou art with God!" </P>

    The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and beyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love. In was in that quarter, quia multum amavit,--because he loved much--that he was regarded as vulnerable by "serious men," "grave persons" and "reasonable people"; favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. What was this excess of love? It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we have already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to things. He lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God's creation. Every man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals. The Bishop of D---- had none of that harshness, which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did not go as far as the Brahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes: "Who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?" Hideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, troubled him not, and did not arouse his indignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. It seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for them. He seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties. He examined without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in nature. This revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One morning he was in his garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister was walking behind him, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider. His sister heard him say:-- </P>

    "Poor beast! It is not its fault!" </P>

    Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness? Puerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to Saint Francis d'Assisi and of Marcus Aurelius. One day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant. Thus lived this just man. Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was nothing more venerable possible. </P>

    Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth, and even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate, and, possibly, a violent man. His universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly, thought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist apertures made by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; these formations are indestructible. </P>

    In 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifth birthday, but he did not appear to be more than sixty. He was not tall; he was rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond of taking long strolls on foot; his step was firm, and his form was but slightly bent, a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect and smiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop. Monseigneur Welcome had what the people term a "fine head," but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine. </P>

    When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease with him, and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person. His fresh and ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved, and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man, "He's a good fellow"; and of an old man, "He is a fine man." That, it will be recalled, was the effect which he produced upon Napoleon. On the first encounter, and to one who saw him for the first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine man. But if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in the least degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, and took on some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad and serious brow, rendered august by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation; majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodness ceased not to be radiant; one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing to smile. Respect, an unutterable respect, penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart, and one felt that one had before him one of those strong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle. </P>

    As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion, alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit of land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence, study, work, filled every day of his life. Filled is exactly the word; certainly the Bishop's day was quite full to the brim, of good words and good deeds. Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed, and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite with him, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens. Sometimes, if the two old women were not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night. He was there alone, communing with himself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of God, opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments, while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation, he could not have told himself, probably, what was passing in his spirit; he felt something take its flight from him, and something descend into him. Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe! </P>

    He thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity, that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more strange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into all his senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible, he gazed upon it. He did not study God; he was dazzled by him. He considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms, which communicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them, create individualities in unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable in the infinite, and, through light, produce beauty. These conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly; hence life and death. </P>

    He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepit vine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds, was dear to him, and satisfied his wants. </P>

    What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of his life, where there was so little leisure, between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night? Was not this narrow enclosure, with the heavens for a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in his most divine works, in turn? Does not this comprehend all, in fact? and what is there left to desire beyond it? A little garden in which to walk, and immensity in which to dream. At one's feet that which can be cultivated and plucked; over head that which one can study and meditate upon: some flowers on earth, and all the stars in the sky.</P>

    在宗教的真谛问题上，我们对迪涅的主教先生不能作任何窥测。面对着象他那样一颗心，我们只能有敬佩的心情。我们应当完全信服一个心地正直的人。并且，我们认为，在具备了某些品质的情况下，人的品德的各种美都是可以在和我们不同的信仰中得到发展的。</P>

    他对这样一种教义或那样一种神秘究竟作何理解呢？那些隐在心灵深处的秘密，只有那迎接赤裸裸的灵魂的坟墓才能知道。不过有一点我们可以肯定，那就是，在解决信仰方面的困难问题时，他从来不采取口是心非的虚伪态度。金刚石是决不至于腐烂的。他尽他力所能及，竭诚信仰。“信天父。”①他常说。此外，他还在行善中希求一定程度的、无愧于良心也无愧于上帝的满足。</P>

    我们认为应当指出的是，主教在他的信心之外（不妨这样说）和这信心之上，还存在着一种过分的仁爱。正是在那上面，“由于多爱”②，他才被那些“端庄”、“严肃”和“通达”的人认为是有缺点的；“端庄”、“严肃”、“通达”这些字眼也正是我们这个凄惨世界里那些全凭贬抑别人来夸耀自己的人所喜闻乐见的。他那种过分的仁爱是什么？是一种冷静的对人关切的心，他关心众人，正如我们指出过的已经无微不至，有时还关心到其他的生物。他一生不曾有过奚落人的心。他对上帝的创造从不苛求。任何人，即使是最善良的人，对待动物，无意中总还保留一种暴戾之气。许多神甫都具有这种暴戾之气，而迪涅的这位主教却一点也没有。他虽然还没有达到婆罗门教的境界，但对圣书中“谁知道动物的灵魂归宿何处？”这一句话，似乎作过深长的思索。外形的丑陋和本性的怪异都不能惊动他，触犯他。他却反而会受到感动，几乎起爱怜的心。他聚精会神，仿佛要在生命的表相之外追究出其所以然的根源、理由或苦衷。有时他好象还恳求上帝加以改造。他用语言学家考证古人遗墨的眼光，平心静气地观察自然界中迄今还存在着的多种多样的混乱现象。那种遐想有时会使他说出一些怪话。一天早晨，他正在园里，他以为身边没有人，其实他的妹子在他后面跟着走，他没有瞧见，忽然，他停下来，望着地上的一件东西，一只黑色、毛茸茸、怪可怕的大蜘蛛。他妹子听见他说：</P>

    “可怜虫！这不是它的过错。” </P>

    ①“信天父”，原文为拉丁文CredoinPatrem。</P>

    ②“由于多爱”，原文为拉丁文quiamultumamavit。</P>

    那种出自菩萨心肠的孩儿话，为什么不可以说呢？当然那是一种稚气，但是这种绝妙的稚气也正是阿西西的圣方济各①和马可·奥里略②有过的。一天，他为了不肯踏死一只蚂蚁，竟扭伤了筋骨。 </P>

    ①圣方济各（FrancoisdAAssise，1181?226），一译“法兰西斯”，方济各会创始人，生于意大利阿西西。一二○九年成立“方济各托钵修会”，修士自称“小兄弟”，故又名“小兄弟会”。</P>

    ②马可·奥里略（MarcAurèle，121?80），罗马皇帝，斯多葛派哲学家。</P>

    这个正直的人便是这样过活的。有时他睡在自己的园里，那真是一种最能令人向往的事。</P>

    据传说，卞福汝主教从前在青年时期，甚至在壮年时期，都曾是一个热情的人，也许还是一个粗暴的人。他后来的那种溥及一切的仁慈，与其说是天赋的本性，不如说是他在生活过程中一步步逐渐达到大彻大悟的结果，因为，人心和岩石一样，也可以有被水滴穿的孔。那些空隙是不会消失的，那些成绩是毁灭不了的。</P>

    在一八一五年，我们好象已经说过，他已到了七十五岁，但是看去好象还没有过六十。他的身材是矮矮胖胖的，为了避免肥满，他常喜欢作长距离的步行；他腿力仍健，背稍微伛一点，这些全是不重要的事，我们不打算在这上面作什么结论。格列高利十六①到了八十岁还是身躯挺直、笑容满面的，但他仍是一个坏主教。卞福汝主教的相貌正象老乡们所说的那种“美男子”，但他的和蔼性格已使人忘了他面貌的美。 </P>

    ①格列高利十六（GrégoireXVI，1765?846），一八三一年至一八四六年为罗马教皇。</P>

    他在谈话中不时嬉笑，有些孩子气，那也是他的风采之一。这我们已经说过了，我们和他接近就会感到身心怡畅，好象他的谈笑会带来满座春风。他的肤色红润，他保全了一嘴洁白的牙齿，笑时露出来，给他添上一种坦率和平易近人的神气，那种神气可以使一个壮年人被人称为“好孩子”，也可以使一个老年人被人称为“好汉子”。我们记得，他当年给拿破仑的印象正是这样的。乍一看来，他在初次和他见面的人的心目中，确也只不过是一个好汉子。但是如果我们和他接触了几小时，只须稍稍望见他运用心思，那个好汉子便慢慢变了样，会令人莫名其妙地肃然生畏；他那广而庄重、原就在白发下显得尊严的前额，也因潜心思考而倍加尊严了；威神出自慈祥，而慈祥之气仍不停散布；我们受到的感动，正如看见一个笑容可掬的天使在缓缓展开他的翅膀，一面仍不停地露着笑容。一种敬意，一种无可言喻的敬意会油然而生，直入你的胸臆，于是我们感到在我们面前的确是一位坚定、饱经世故的仁厚长者，他的胸襟既那么开朗，那他的思想也就必然温柔敦厚的了。</P>

    我们已经见过，他一生中每一天的时刻都是被祈祷、上祭、布施、安慰伤心人、种一小块园地、实行仁爱、节食、招待过路客人、克己、信人、学习、劳动这些事充满了的。“充满”这两个字是恰当的，并且主教过的这种日子又一定洋溢着善良的思想、善良的言语和善良的行为，直到完善的境界。但是，到了晚上，当那两个妇女已经退去休息时，如果天冷，或是下雨，使他不能到园里去待上一两个钟点再去就寝的话，他那一天也还是过得不满足的。面对着太虚中寥廓的夜景，缪然默念，以待瞌睡，在他，这好象已是一种仪轨了。有时，夜深人静以后，那两个老妇人如果还没有睡着，她们常听见他在那几条小道上缓步徘徊。他在那里，独自一人，虔诚，恬静，爱慕一切，拿自己心中的谧静去比拟太空的谧静，从黑暗中去感受星斗的有形的美和上帝的无形的美。那时，夜花正献出它们的香气，他也献出了他的心，他的心正象一盏明灯，点在繁星闪闪的中央，景仰赞叹，飘游在造物的无边无际的光辉里。他自己也许说不出萦绕在他心中的究竟是什么，他只感到有东西从他体中飞散出去，也有东西降落回来。心灵的幽奥和宇宙的幽奥的神秘的交往！</P>

    他想到上帝的伟大，也想到上帝和他同在；想到绵绵无尽的将来是一种深不可测的神秘，无可穷竟的往古，更是神秘渺茫；想到宇宙在他的眼底朝着各个方面无止境地扩展延伸；他不强求了解这种无法了解的现象，但是他凝神注视着一切。他不研究上帝，他为之心旷神怡。他涉想到原子的奇妙结合能使物质具有形象，能在组合时发生力量，在整体中创造出个体，在空间创造出广度和长度，在无极中创造出无量数，并能通过光线显示美。那样的结合，生生灭灭，了无尽期，因而有生死。</P>

    他坐在一条木凳上，靠着一个朽了的葡萄架，穿过那些果树的瘦弱蜷屈的暗影，仰望群星。在那四分之一亩的地方，树木既种得那样少，残棚破屋又那么挤，但是他留恋它，心里也知足。</P>

    这个老人一生的空闲时间既那么少，那一点空闲时间在白天又已被园艺占去，在晚上也已用在沉思冥想，他还有什么希求呢？那一小块园地，上有天空，不是已足供他用来反复景仰上帝的最美妙的工作和最卓绝的工作吗？的确，难道那样不已经十全十美，还有什么可奢求的呢？一院小小的园地供他盘桓，一片浩阔的天空供他神游。脚下有东西供他培植收获，头上有东西供他探讨思索，地下的是几朵花，天上的是万点星。</P>

 Part 1 Book 1 Chapter 14 What he thought

    One last word.</P>

    Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment, and to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D---- a certain "pantheistical" physiognomy, and induce the belief, either to his credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of those persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this man was his heart. His wisdom was made of the light which comes from there.</P>

    No systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no, there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses. The apostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds. There is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma; those gloomy openings stand yawning there, but something tells you, you, a passer-by in life, that you must not enter. Woe to him who penetrates thither!</P>

    Geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation, situated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their ideas to God. Their prayer audaciously offers discussion. Their adoration interrogates. This is direct religion, which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs.</P>

    Human meditation has no limits. At his own risk and peril, it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, that by a sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received; it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated.</P>

    However that may be, there are on earth men who--are they men?-- perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute, and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcome was one of these men; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius. He would have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even, like Swedenborg and Pascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these powerful reveries have their moral utility, and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection. As for him, he took the path which shortens,-- the Gospel's.</P>

    He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah's mantle; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events; he did not see to condense in flame the light of things; he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him. This humble soul loved, and that was all.</P>

    That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable: but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much; and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and Saint Jerome would be heretics.</P>

    He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universe appeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever, everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to solve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied only in finding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve. That which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation.</P>

    There are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction of pity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness. Love each other; he declared this to be complete, desired nothing further, and that was the whole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to be a "philosopher," the senator who has already been alluded to, said to the Bishop: "Just survey the spectacle of the world: all war against all; the strongest has the most wit. Your love each other is nonsense."--"Well," replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contesting the point, "if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it, as the pearl in the oyster." Thus he shut himself up, he lived there, he was absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives of abstraction, the precipices of metaphysics--all those profundities which converge, for the apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness; destiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscience of man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformation in death, the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains, the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent _I_, the essence, the substance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature, liberty, necessity; perpendicular problems, sinister obscurities, where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind; formidable abysses, which Lucretius, Manou, Saint Paul, Dante, contemplate with eyes flashing lightning, which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there.</P>

    Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troubling his own mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness.</P>

    最后几句话。</P>

    由于这种详细的叙述，特别是在我们这时代，很可能赋予迪涅的这位主教一副泛神论者（暂用一个目下正流行的名词）的面貌，加以我们这世纪中的哲学流派多，那些纷纭的思想有时会在生活孤寂的人的精神上发芽成长，扩大影响，直到取宗教思想的地位而代之，我们的叙述，又还可以使人认为他也有他一套独特的人生观，无论这对他是指责还是赞扬，我们都应当着重指出，凡是认识卞福汝主教的人，没有一个敢有那样的想法。他之所以光明磊落，是由于他的心，他的智慧正是由那里发出的光构成的。</P>

    他不守成规，又勇于任事。探赜索隐，每每使他神志昏瞀；他是否窥探过玄学，毫无迹象可寻。使徒行事，可以大刀阔斧，主教却应当谨小慎微。他也许认为某些问题是应当留待大智大慧的人去探讨的，他自己如果推究太深，于心反而不安。玄学的门，神圣骇人，那些幽暗的洞口，一一向人大开，但是有一种声音向你这生命中的过客说“进去不得”。进去的人都将不幸！而那些天才，置身于教律之上（不妨这样说），从抽象观念和唯理学说的无尽深渊中，向上帝提出他们的意见。他们的祷告发出了大胆的争论。他们的颂赞带着疑难。这是一种想直接证悟的宗教，妄图攀援绝壁的人必将烦恼重重，自食其果。</P>

    人类的遐想是没有止境的。人常在遐想中不避艰险，分析研究并深入追求他自己所赞叹的妙境。我们几乎可以这样说，由于一种奇妙的反应作用，人类的遐想可以使宇宙惊奇，围绕着我们的这个神秘世界能吐其所纳，瞻望的人们也就很有被瞻望的可能。无论怎样，这世上确有一些人（如果他们仅仅是人），能在梦想的视野深处清清楚楚地望见绝对真理的高度和无极山峰的惊心触目的景象。卞福汝主教完全不是这种人，卞福汝主教不是天才。他也许害怕那种绝顶的聪明，有几个人，并且是才气磅礴的人，例如斯维登堡①和帕斯卡尔②，就是因为聪明绝顶而堕入精神失常的状态的。固然，那种强烈的梦想，对人的身心自有它的用处，并且通过那条险阻的道路，我们可以达到理想中的至善境界。可是他，他采择了一条捷径棗《福音书》。</P>

    他绝不想使他的祭服具有以利亚③的法衣的皱褶，他对这黑暗世界中人事的兴衰起伏，不怀任何希冀；他不希望能使一事一物的微光集成烈火，他丝毫没有那些先知和方士们的臭味。他那颗质朴的心只知道爱，如是而已。 </P>

    ①斯维登堡（Swedenborg，1688?772），瑞典通灵论者。</P>

    ②帕斯卡尔（Pascal，1623?662），法国数学家，物理学家，哲学家。</P>

    ③以利亚（Elie），犹太先知（《圣经·列王记》）。</P>

    他的祈祷具有一种不同于一般人的憧憬，那是极可能的，但是必须先有极其殷切的爱，才能作出极其殷切的祈祷，如果祈祷的内容越出了经文的规范，便被认为异端，那么，圣泰莉莎和圣热罗姆岂不都成了异端了？</P>

    他常照顾那些呻吟床褥和奄奄垂毙的人。这世界在他看来好象是一种漫无边际的病苦，他觉得遍地都是寒热，他四处诊察疾苦，他不想猜破谜底，只试图包扎创伤。人间事物的惨状使他具有悲天悯人的心，他一心一意想找出可以安慰人心和解除痛苦的最妥善的办法，那是为他自己也是为了影响旁人。世间存在的一切事物，对这位不可多得的慈悲神甫，都是引起恻隐之心和济世宏愿的永恒的动力。</P>

    多少人在努力发掘黄金，他却只努力发掘慈悲心肠。普天下的愁苦便是他的矿。遍地的苦痛随时为他提供行善的机会。</P>

    “你们应当彼此相爱”，他说如果能这样，便一切具足了，不必再求其他，这便是他的全部教义。一天，那个自命为“哲学家”的元老院元老（我们已经提到过他的名字）对他说：“您瞧瞧这世上的情形吧，人自为战，谁胜利，谁就有理。您的‘互爱’简直是胡说。”卞福汝主教并不和他争论，只回答：“好吧，即使是胡说，人的心总还应当隐藏在那里，如同珍珠隐在蚌壳里一样。”他自己便隐藏在那里，生活在那里，绝对心满意足，不理睬那些诱人而又骇人的重大问题，如抽象理论的无可揣摹的远景以及形而上学的探渊，所有那些针对同一问题的玄妙理论他都抛在一边，留给上帝的信徒和否定上帝的虚无论者去处理，这些玄论有命运、善恶、生物和生物间的斗争、动物的半睡眠半思想状态、死后的转化、坟墓中的生命总结、宿世的恩情对今生的“我”的那种不可理解的纠缠、元精、实质、色空、灵魂、本性、自由、必然，还有代表人类智慧的巨神们所探索的那些穷高极深的问题，还有卢克莱修①、摩奴②、圣保罗和但丁曾以炬火似的目光，凝神仰望那仿佛能使群星跃出的浩阔天空。</P>

    卞福汝主教是一个普普通通的人，他只从表面涉猎那些幽渺的问题，他不深究，也不推波助澜，免得自己的精神受到骚扰，但是在他的心灵中，对于幽冥，却怀着一种深厚的敬畏。 </P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 1 The Evening of a Day of Walking

    Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D---- The few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was a man of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life. He might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by sun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view of his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back; an enormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a shaved head and a long beard.</P>

    The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was closely cut, yet bristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem to have been cut for some time.</P>

    No one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came he? From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance into D---- by the same street which, seven months previously, had witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes to Paris. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed very much fatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi, and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade. He must have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in the market-place.</P>

    On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left, and directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out a quarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on the stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D---- the proclamation of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme.</P>

    The gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at him, followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.</P>

    There then existed at D---- a fine inn at the sign of the Cross of Colbas. This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another Labarre, who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble, and had served in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor's landing, many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the Three Dauphins. It was said that General Bertrand, disguised as a carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor entered Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, "I am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance"; and he had betaken himself to the Three Dauphins. This glory of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins was reflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas, at a distance of five and twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, "That is the cousin of the man of Grenoble."</P>

    The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the country-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the street. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from one stew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks, was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge carps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.</P>

    The host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said, without raising his eyes from his stoves:--</P>

    "What do you wish, sir?"</P>

    "Food and lodging," said the man.</P>

    "Nothing easier," replied the host. At that moment he turned his head, took in the traveller's appearance with a single glance, and added, "By paying for it."</P>

    The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse,and answered, "I have money."</P>

    "In that case, we are at your service," said the host.</P>

    The man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from his back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his hand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D---- is in the mountains. The evenings are cold there in October.</P>

    But as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.</P>

    "Will dinner be ready soon?" said the man.</P>

    "Immediately," replied the landlord.</P>

    While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back turned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket, then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line or two, folded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey. The landlord whispered a word in the scullion's ear, and the child set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall.</P>

    The traveller saw nothing of all this.</P>

    Once more he inquired, "Will dinner be ready soon?"</P>

    "Immediately," responded the host.</P>

    The child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded it eagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to read it attentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment. Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene.</P>

    "I cannot receive you, sir," said he.</P>

    The man half rose.</P>

    "What! Are you afraid that I will not pay you? Do you want me to pay you in advance? I have money, I tell you."</P>

    "It is not that."</P>

    "What then?"</P>

    "You have money--"</P>

    "Yes," said the man.</P>

    "And I," said the host, "have no room."</P>

    The man resumed tranquilly, "Put me in the stable."</P>

    "I cannot."</P>

    "Why?"</P>

    "The horses take up all the space."</P>

    "Very well!" retorted the man; "a corner of the loft then, a truss of straw. We will see about that after dinner."</P>

    "I cannot give you any dinner."</P>

    This declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger as grave. He rose.</P>

    "Ah! bah! But I am dying of hunger. I have been walking since sunrise. I have travelled twelve leagues. I pay. I wish to eat."</P>

    "I have nothing," said the landlord.</P>

    The man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves: "Nothing! and all that?"</P>

    "All that is engaged."</P>

    "By whom?"</P>

    "By messieurs the wagoners."</P>

    "How many are there of them?"</P>

    "Twelve."</P>

    "There is enough food there for twenty."</P>

    "They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance."</P>

    The man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, "I am at an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain."</P>

    Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him start, "Go away!"</P>

    At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned quickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed steadily at him and added, still in a low voice: "Stop! there's enough of that sort of talk. Do you want me to tell you your name? Your name is Jean Valjean. Now do you want me to tell you who you are? When I saw you come in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this was the reply that was sent to me. Can you read?"</P>

    So saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the town-hall to the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord resumed after a pause.</P>

    "I am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!"</P>

    The man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground, and took his departure.</P>

    He chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture, keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not turn round a single time. Had he done so, he would have seen the host of the Cross of Colbas standing on his threshold, surrounded by all the guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking vivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.</P>

    He saw nothing of all this. People who are crushed do not look behind them. They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.</P>

    Thus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue, as is often the case when a man is sad. All at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply. Night was drawing near. He glanced about him, to see whether he could not discover some shelter.</P>

    The fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humble public house, some hovel, however lowly.</P>

    Just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branch suspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight. He proceeded thither.</P>

    It proved to be, in fact, a public house. The public house which is in the Rue de Chaffaut.</P>

    The wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into the interior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth. Some men were engaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. An iron pot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.</P>

    The entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is by two doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filled with manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slipped into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and opened the door.</P>

    "Who goes there?" said the master.</P>

    "Some one who wants supper and bed."</P>

    "Good. We furnish supper and bed here."</P>

    He entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.</P>

    The host said to him, "There is the fire. The supper is cooking in the pot. Come and warm yourself, comrade."</P>

    He approached and seated himself near the hearth. He stretched out his feet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was emitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished of his face, beneath his cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance of comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows.</P>

    It was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. This physiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and ended by seeming severe. The eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood.</P>

    One of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who, before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to stable his horse at Labarre's. It chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras d'Asse and--I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon. Now, when he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had requested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait. This fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin Labarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the Cross of Colbas. From where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went to him. They exchanged a few words in a low tone. The man had again become absorbed in his reflections.</P>

    The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man, and said to him:--</P>

    "You are going to get out of here."</P>

    The stranger turned round and replied gently, "Ah! You know?--"</P>

    "Yes."</P>

    "I was sent away from the other inn."</P>

    "And you are to be turned out of this one."</P>

    "Where would you have me go?"</P>

    "Elsewhere."</P>

    The man took his stick and his knapsack and departed.</P>

    As he went out, some children who had followed him from the Cross of Colbas, and who seemed to be lying in wait for him, threw stones at him. He retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his stick: the children dispersed like a flock of birds.</P>

    He passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell. He rang.</P>

    The wicket opened.</P>

    "Turnkey," said he, removing his cap politely, "will you have the kindness to admit me, and give me a lodging for the night?"</P>

    A voice replied:--</P>

    "The prison is not an inn. Get yourself arrested, and you will be admitted."</P>

    The wicket closed again.</P>

    He entered a little street in which there were many gardens. Some of them are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the street. In the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story, the window of which was lighted up. He peered through the pane as he had done at the public house. Within was a large whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff, and a cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled gun hanging on the wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room. A copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking soup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a merry and open countenance, who was dandling a little child on his knees. Close by a very young woman was nursing another child. The father was laughing, the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.</P>

    The stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming spectacle. What was taking place within him? He alone could have told. It is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he would find perhaps a little pity.</P>

    He tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.</P>

    They did not hear him.</P>

    He tapped again.</P>

    He heard the woman say, "It seems to me, husband, that some one is knocking."</P>

    "No," replied the husband.</P>

    He tapped a third time.</P>

    The husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.</P>

    He was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. He wore a huge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a hammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out. He carried his head thrown backwards; his shirt, widely opened and turned back, displayed his bull neck, white and bare. He had thick eyelashes, enormous black whiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of his face like a snout; and besides all this, that air of being on his own ground, which is indescribable.</P>

    "Pardon me, sir," said the wayfarer, "Could you, in consideration of payment, give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the garden, in which to sleep? Tell me; can you? For money?"</P>

    "Who are you?" demanded the master of the house.</P>

    The man replied: "I have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have walked all day long. I have travelled twelve leagues. Can you?-- if I pay?"</P>

    "I would not refuse," said the peasant, "to lodge any respectable man who would pay me. But why do you not go to the inn?"</P>

    "There is no room."</P>

    "Bah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you been to Labarre?"</P>

    "Yes."</P>

    "Well?"</P>

    The traveller replied with embarrassment: "I do not know. He did not receive me."</P>

    "Have you been to What's-his-name's, in the Rue Chaffaut?"</P>

    The stranger's embarrassment increased; he stammered, "He did not receive me either."</P>

    The peasant's countenance assumed an expression of distrust; he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a sort of shudder:--</P>

    "Are you the man?--"</P>

    He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards, placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.</P>

    Meanwhile, at the words, Are you the man? the woman had risen, had clasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger, with her bosom uncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured in a low tone, "Tso-maraude."[1]</P>

    [1] Patois of the French Alps: chat de maraude, rascally marauder.</P>

    All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to one's self. After having scrutinized the man for several moments, as one scrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door and said:--</P>

    "Clear out!"</P>

    "For pity's sake, a glass of water," said the man.</P>

    "A shot from my gun!" said the peasant.</P>

    Then he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two large bolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.</P>

    Night continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens which bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be built of sods. He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found himself in the garden. He approached the hut; its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which road-laborers construct for themselves along the roads. He thought without doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he was suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter from the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night. He threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut. It was warm there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a moment, stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, so fatigued was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in his way, and as it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, he set about unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, a ferocious growl became audible. He raised his eyes. The head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.</P>

    It was a dog's kennel.</P>

    He was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his staff, made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.</P>

    He left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, in order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte.</P>

    When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found himself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter, without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, "I am not even a dog!"</P>

    He soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town, hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter.</P>

    He walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he felt himself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him. He was in a field. Before him was one of those low hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest, resemble shaved heads.</P>

    The horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity of night; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole sky. Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth.</P>

    The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces a particularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor and mean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The whole effect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.</P>

    There was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree, which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.</P>

    This man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, in that hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundly desolate, that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back abruptly. There are instants when nature seems hostile.</P>

    He retraced his steps; the gates of D---- were closed. D----, which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded in 1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since. He passed through a breach and entered the town again.</P>

    It might have been eight o'clock in the evening. As he was not acquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.</P>

    In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he passed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.</P>

    At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It is there that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard to the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleon himself, were printed for the first time.</P>

    Worn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.</P>

    At that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the man stretched out in the shadow. "What are you doing there, my friend?" said she.</P>

    He answered harshly and angrily: "As you see, my good woman, I am sleeping." The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, was the Marquise de R----</P>

    "On this bench?" she went on.</P>

    "I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years," said the man; "to-day I have a mattress of stone."</P>

    "You have been a soldier?"</P>

    "Yes, my good woman, a soldier."</P>

    "Why do you not go to the inn?"</P>

    "Because I have no money."</P>

    "Alas!" said Madame de R----, "I have only four sous in my purse."</P>

    "Give it to me all the same."</P>

    The man took the four sous. Madame de R---- continued: "You cannot obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum. But have you tried? It is impossible for you to pass the night thus. You are cold and hungry, no doubt. Some one might have given you a lodging out of charity."</P>

    "I have knocked at all doors."</P>

    "Well?"</P>

    "I have been driven away everywhere."</P>

    The "good woman" touched the man's arm, and pointed out to him on the other side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside the Bishop's palace.</P>

    "You have knocked at all doors?"</P>

    "Yes."</P>

    "Have you knocked at that one?"</P>

    "No."</P>

    "Knock there."</P>

    一八一五年十月初，距日落前约一点钟，有一个步行的人走进了那小小的迪涅城。稀稀落落的居民在他们家门口或窗前，带着一种不安的心情瞧着这个行人。要碰见一个比他更褴褛的过路人是很不容易的了。他是一个中等身材的人，体格粗壮，正在盛年，可能有四十六或四十八岁。一顶皮檐便帽压齐眉心，把他那被太阳晒黑、淌着大汗的脸遮去了一部分。从他那领上扣一个小银锚的黄粗布衬衫里露出一部分毛茸茸的胸脯，他的领带扭得象根绳子，蓝棉布裤也磨损不堪，一个膝头成了白色，一个膝头有了窟窿；一件破旧褴褛的老灰布衫，左右两肘上都已用麻线缝上了一块绿呢布；他背上有只布袋，装得满满的也扣得紧紧的；手里拿根多节的粗棍，一双没有穿袜子的脚踩在两只钉鞋里，光头，长须。</P>

    汗、热、奔走和徒步旅行替那潦倒的人添上了一种说不出的狼狈神情。</P>

    他的头发原是剃光了的，但现在又茸茸满头了，因为又开始长出了一点，还好象多时没有修剪过似的。</P>

    谁也不认识他，他自然只是一个过路人。他是从什么地方来的呢？从南方来的。或是从海滨来的。因为他进迪涅城所走的路，正是七个月前拿破仑皇帝从戛纳去巴黎时所经过的路。这个人一定已走了一整天，他那神气显得异常疲乏。许多住在下城旧区里的妇人看见他在加桑第大路的树底下歇了一回脚，又在那广场尽头的水管里喝了些水。他一定渴极了，因为追着他的那些孩子还看见他在两百步外的那个小菜场的水管下停下来喝了水。</P>

    走到了巴许维街转角的地方，他向左转，朝市政厅走去。他进去，一刻钟过后又走了出来。有个警察坐在门旁的石凳上，那正是三月四日德鲁埃将军立上去向着惊骇万状的迪涅民众宣读茹安港①宣言的那条石凳。那汉子脱下他的便帽，向那警察恭恭敬敬行了一个礼。</P>

    警察没有答礼，只仔细打量了他一会，眼光送了他一程，就走到市政厅里去了。</P>

    当时，迪涅有一家华美的旅舍叫“柯耳巴十字架”。旅舍主人是雅甘·拉巴尔。城里的人都认为他是另外一个拉巴尔的亲族，另外那个拉巴尔在格勒诺布尔开着三太子旅舍，并且做过向导②。据当时传说，正月间贝特朗将军曾经乔装为车夫，在那一带地方往来过多次，把许多十字勋章分给一些士兵，把大量的拿破仑③分给一些士绅。实在的情形是这样的：皇帝进入格勒诺布尔城以后，不愿住在省长公署里，他谢了那位市长，他说：“我要到一个我认识的好汉家里去住。”他去的地方便是那三太子旅舍。三太子旅舍的那个拉巴尔所得的荣耀一直照射到二十五法里以外的这个柯耳巴十字架旅舍的拉巴尔。城里的人都说他是格勒诺布尔那位的堂兄弟。 </P>

    ①茹安港（Juan）在戛纳附近，拿破仑在此登陆时曾发出宣言。</P>

    ②替拿破仑当向导。</P>

    ③拿破仑，金币名，值二十法郎。</P>

    那人正向着这旅舍走去，它是这地方最好的旅舍了。他走进了厨房，厨房的门临街，也和街道一般平。所有的灶都升了火，一炉大火在壁炉里熊熊地烧着。那旅舍主人，同时也就是厨师，从灶心管到锅盏，正忙着照顾，替许多车夫预备一顿丰盛的晚餐，他们可以听见车夫们在隔壁屋子里大声谈笑。凡是旅行过的人都知道再也没有什么人比那些车夫吃得更考究的了。穿在长叉上的一只肥田鼠夹在一串白竹鸡和一串雄山雉中间，在火前转动。炉子上还烹着两条乐愁湖的青鱼和一尾阿绿茨湖的鲈鱼。</P>

    那主人听见门开了，又来了一个新客人，两只眼睛仍望着炉子，也不抬头，他说：</P>

    “先生要什么？”</P>

    “吃和睡。”那人说。</P>

    “再容易也没有，”主人回答说。这时，他转过头，目光射在旅客身上，又接着说：“……要付钱的呀。”</P>

    那人从他布衫的袋里掏出一只大钱包，回答说：</P>

    “我有钱。”</P>

    “好，我就来伺候您。”主人说。</P>

    那人把钱包塞回衣袋里，取下行囊，放在门边的地上，手里仍拿着木棍，去坐在火旁边的一张矮凳上。迪涅在山区，十月的夜晚是寒冷的。</P>

    但是，旅舍主人去了又来，来了又去，总在打量这位旅客。</P>

    “马上有东西吃吗？”那人问。</P>

    “得稍微等一会儿。”旅舍主人说。</P>

    这时，新来的客人正转过背去烘火，那位象煞有介事的旅舍主人从衣袋里抽出一支铅笔，又从丢在窗台旁小桌子上的那张旧报纸上扯下一角。他在那白报纸边上写了一两行字，又把这张破纸折好，并不封，交给一个好象是他的厨役又同时是他的跑腿的小厮。旅舍主人还在那小伙计耳边说了一句话，小伙计便朝着市政厅的方向跑去了。</P>

    那旅客一点也没有看见这些经过。</P>

    他又问了一次：</P>

    “马上有东西吃吗？”</P>

    “还得等一会儿。”旅舍主人说。</P>

    那孩子回来了。他带回了那张纸。主人急忙把它打开，好象一个等候回音的人，他仿佛细心地读了一遍，随后又点头，想了想。他终于朝着那心神似乎不大安定的旅客走上一步。</P>

    “先生，”他说，“我不能接待您。”</P>

    那个人从他的坐位上半挺着身子。</P>

    “怎么！您恐怕我不付钱吗？您要不要我先会账？我有钱呢，我告诉您。”</P>

    “不是为那个。”</P>

    “那么是为什么？”</P>

    “您有钱……”</P>

    “有。”那人说。</P>

    “但是我，”主人说，“我没有房间。”</P>

    那人和颜悦色地说：“把我安顿在马房里就是了。”</P>

    “我不能。”</P>

    “为什么？”</P>

    “那些马把所有的地方都占了。”</P>

    “那么，”那人又说，“阁楼上面的一个角落也可以。一捆草就够了。我们吃了饭再看吧。”</P>

    “我不能开饭给您吃。”</P>

    那个外来人对这种有分寸而又坚硬的表示感到严重了，他站立起来。</P>

    “哈！笑话！我快饿死了，我。太阳出来，我就走起。走了十二法里①的路程。我并不是不付钱。我要吃。” </P>

    ①一法里等于现在的四公里。</P>

    “我一点东西也没有。”旅舍主人说。</P>

    那汉子放声大笑，转身朝着那炉灶。</P>

    “没有东西！那是什么？”</P>

    “那些东西全是客人定了的。”</P>

    “谁定的？”</P>

    “那些车夫先生定了的。”</P>

    “他们多少人？”</P>

    “十二个人。”</P>

    “那里有二十个人吃的东西。”</P>

    “那都是预先定好并且付了钱的。”</P>

    那个人又坐下去，用同样的口吻说：</P>

    “我已经到了这客栈里，我饿了，我不走。”</P>

    那主人弯下身子，凑到他耳边，用一种使他吃惊的口吻说：</P>

    “快走。”</P>

    这时，那旅客弯下腰去了，用他棍子的铁梢拨着火里的红炭，他蓦地转过身来，正要开口辩驳，可是那旅舍主人的眼睛盯着他，照先头一样低声说：</P>

    “我说，废话已经说够了。您要我说出您的姓名吗？您叫冉阿让。现在您要我说出您是什么人吗？您进来时，我一见心里就有些疑惑，我已派人到市政厅去过了，这是那里的回信。</P>

    您认识字吗？”</P>

    他一面那样说，一面把那张完全打开了的、从旅舍到市政厅、又从市政厅转回旅舍的纸递给那客人看。客人在纸上瞟了一眼。旅舍主人停了一会不响，接着又说：</P>

    “无论对什么人，我素来都是客客气气的，您还是走吧。”</P>

    那人低下了头，拾起他那只放在地上的布袋走了。</P>

    他沿着那条大街走去。好象一个受了侮辱、满腔委屈的人，他紧靠着墙壁，信步往前走。他的头一次也没有回转过。假使他回转头来，他就会看见那柯耳巴十字架的旅舍主人正立在他门口，旅舍里的旅客和路上的行人都围着他，在那里指手画脚，说长论短；并且从那一堆人的惊疑的目光里，他还可以猜想到他的出现不久就要搞得满城风雨。</P>

    那些经过，他完全没有瞧见。心情沮丧的人，总是不朝后面看的。他们只觉得恶运正追着他们。</P>

    他那样走了一些时候，不停地往前走，信步穿过了许多街道，都是他不认识的，忘了自身的疲乏，人在颓丧时是常有这种情况的。忽然，他感到饿得难熬。天也要黑了。他向四周望去，想发现一处可以过夜的地方。</P>

    那家华丽的旅馆既享以闭门羹，他便想找一家简陋的酒店，一所穷苦的破屋。</P>

    恰好在那条街的尽头，燃起了一盏灯，在半明半暗的暮色中，显出一根松枝，悬在一条曲铁上。他向那地方走去。</P>

    那确是一家酒店。就是沙佛街上的那家酒店。</P>

    那行人停了一会，从玻璃窗口望那酒家底层厅房的内部，看见桌上的灯正点着，壁炉里的火也正燃着。几个人在里面喝酒。老板也傍着火。一只挂在吊钩上的铁锅在火焰中烧得发响。</P>

    这家酒店，同时也是一种客栈，它有两扇门，一扇临街，另一扇通一个粪土混积的小天井。</P>

    那行人不敢由临街的门进去。他先溜进天井，待了一会，再轻轻地提起门闩，把门推开。</P>

    “来的是谁？”那老板问。</P>

    “一个想吃晚饭和过夜的人。”</P>

    “好的，这儿有饭吃，也有地方可以住。”</P>

    跟着，他进去了。那些正在喝酒的人全都转过头来。他这面有灯光照着，那面有火光照着。当他解下那口袋时，大家都打量了他好一会儿。那老板向他说：</P>

    “这儿有火，晚餐也正在锅里煮着。您来烤烤火吧，伙计。”</P>

    他走去坐在炉边，把那两只累伤了的脚伸到火前，一阵香味从锅里冲出。他的脸仍被那顶压到眉心的便帽半遮着，当时所能辨别出来的只是一种若隐若现的舒适神情，同时又搀杂着另外一种由于长期苦痛而起的愁容。</P>

    那是一副坚强有力而又忧郁的侧形。这相貌是稀有的，一眼看去象是谦卑，看到后来，却又严肃。眼睛在眉毛下炯炯发光，正象荆棘丛中的一堆火。</P>

    当时，在那些围着桌子坐下的人中有个鱼贩子。他在走进沙佛街这家酒店以前，到过拉巴尔的旅舍，把他的马寄放在马房里，当天早晨他又偶然碰见过这个面恶的外来人在阿塞湾和……（我已忘了那地名，我想是爱斯古布龙）之间走着。那外来人在遇见他时曾请求让他坐在马臀上，他当时已显得非常困顿了，那鱼贩子却一面支吾，一面加鞭走了。半点钟以前，那鱼贩子也是围着雅甘·拉巴尔那堆人中的一个，并且他亲自把当天早晨那次不愉快的遭遇告诉了柯耳巴十字架旅舍里的那些人。这时他从他座上向那酒店老板使了个眼色。酒店老板就走到他身边。彼此低声交谈了几句。那个赶路的客人却正在想他的心事。</P>

    酒店老板回到壁炉旁边，突然把手放在那人的肩上，向他说：</P>

    “你得离开此地。”</P>

    那个生客转过身来，低声下气地说：</P>

    “唉！您知道？”</P>

    “我知道。”</P>

    “他们把我从那个旅舍里撵了出来。”</P>

    “又要把你从这儿赶出去。”</P>

    “您要我到什么地方去呢？”</P>

    “到旁的地方去。”</P>

    那人提起他的棍和布袋，走了。</P>

    他走出店门，又遇到几个孩子，扔着石子打他，那起孩子是从柯耳巴十字架跟来，专在门口候他出来的。他狼狈地回转来，扬着棍子表示要打，孩子们也就象一群小鸟似的散了。</P>

    他走过监狱，监狱的大门上垂着一根拉钟的铁链。他便拉动那口钟。</P>

    墙上的一个小洞开了。</P>

    “看守先生，”他说，一面恭恭敬敬地脱下他的便帽，“您可愿意开开牢门让我住一宵？”</P>

    有个人的声音回答说：</P>

    “监牢又不是客栈。你得先叫人逮捕你。这门才会替你开。”</P>

    那小墙洞又闭上了。</P>

    他走到一条有许多花园的小街。其中的几处只用篱笆围着，那样可以使街道显得更生动。在那些花园和篱笆之间，他看见一所小平房的窗子里有灯光。他从那玻璃窗朝里看，正好象他先头望那酒店一样。那是一大间用灰浆刷白了的屋子，里面有一张床，床上铺着印花棉布的床单，屋角里有只摇篮，几张木椅，墙上挂着一枝双管枪。屋子中间有桌子，桌上正摆着食物。一盏铜灯照着那块洁白宽大的台布，一把灿烂如银的盛满了酒的锡壶和一只热气腾腾的栗黄汤钵。桌子旁边坐着一个四十岁左右喜笑颜开的男子，他用膝头颠着一个小孩，逗他跳跃。一个年纪正轻的妇人在他旁边喂另外一个婴孩的奶。父亲笑着，孩子笑着，母亲也微微地笑着。</P>

    这个异乡人在那种温柔宁静的景物前出了一会神。他心里想着什么？只有他自己才能说出来。也许他正想着那样一个快乐的家庭应当是肯待客的吧，他在眼前的那片福地上也许找得着一点恻隐之心吧。</P>

    他在玻璃窗上极轻地敲了一下。</P>

    没有人听见。</P>

    他敲第二下。</P>

    他听见那妇人说：</P>

    “当家的，好象有人敲门。”</P>

    “没有。”她丈夫回答。</P>

    他敲第三下。</P>

    那丈夫立起来，拿着灯，走去把门开了。</P>

    他是一个身材高大，半农半工模样的人。身上围着一件宽大的皮围裙，一直围到他的左肩，围裙里有一个铁锤、一条红手巾、一只火药匣、各式各样的东西，都由一根腰带兜住，在他的肚子上鼓起来。他的头朝后仰着，一件翻领衬衫大大敞开，露出了白皙光滑的牛脖子。他有浓厚的眉毛，腮帮上留着一大片黑胡须，眼睛不凹，下颏突出，在那样的面貌上，有一种说不出的怡然自得的神气。</P>

    “先生，”那过路人说，“请原谅。假使我出钱，您能给我一盆汤，让我在园里那棚子里的角上睡一宵？请您说，您可以吗，假使我出钱的话？”</P>

    “您是谁？”那房子的主人问。</P>

    那人回答说：</P>

    “我是从壁马松来的。我走了一整天，我走了十二法里。您同意吗？假使我出钱？”</P>

    “我并不拒绝留宿一个肯付钱的正派人，”那农人说，“但是您为什么不去找客栈呢？”</P>

    “客栈里没有地方了。”</P>

    “笑话！没有的事。今天又不是演杂技的日子，又不是赶集的日子。您到拉巴尔家去过没有？”</P>

    “去过了。”</P>

    “怎样呢？”</P>

    那过路人感到为难，他回答说：</P>

    “我不知道，他不肯接待我。”</P>

    “您到沙佛街上那叫做什么的家里去过没有？”</P>

    那个外来人更感困难了，他吞吞吐吐地说：</P>

    “他也不肯接待我。”</P>

    那农民的脸上立刻起了戒惧的神情，他从头到脚打量那陌生人，并且忽然用一种战栗的声音喊着说：</P>

    “难道您就是那个人吗？……”</P>

    他又对那外来人看了一眼，向后退三步，把灯放在桌上，从墙上取下了他的枪。</P>

    那妇人听见那农民说“难道您就是那个人吗？……”以后，也立了起来，抱着她的两个孩子，赶忙躲在她丈夫背后，惊慌失措地瞧着那个陌生人，敞着胸口，睁大了眼睛，她低声说：“佐马洛德。”①这些动作比我们想象的还快些。屋主把那“人”当作毒蛇观察了一番之后，又回到门前，说道：</P>

    “滚！”</P>

    “求您做做好事，”那人又说，“给我一杯水吧！”</P>

    “给你一枪！”农民说。 </P>

    ①佐马洛德（tsoCmaraude），法国境内阿尔卑斯山区的方言，即野猫。棗作者原注。</P>

    随后他把门使劲关上，那人还听见他推动两条大门闩的声音。过一会儿，板窗也关上了，一阵上铁门的声音直达外面。</P>

    天越来越黑了。阿尔卑斯山中已经起了冷风。那个无家可归的人从苍茫的暮色中看见街边的一个花园里有个茅棚，望去仿佛是草墩搭起来的。他下定决心，越过一道木栅栏，便到了那园里。他朝着那茅棚走去，它的门只是一个狭而很低的洞，正象那些筑路工人替自己在道旁盖起的那种风雨棚。他当然也认为那确实是一个筑路工人歇脚的地方，现在他感到又冷又饿，实在难熬。他虽然已不再希望得到食物，但至少那还是一个避寒的地方。那种棚子照例在晚上是没有人住的。他全身躺下，爬了进去。里面相当温暖，地上还铺了一层麦秸。他在那上面躺了一会，他实在太疲倦了，一点也不能动。随后，因为他背上还压着一个口袋，使他很不舒服，再说，这正是一个现成的枕头，他便动手解开那捆口袋的皮带。正在这时，他忽然听见一阵粗暴的声音。他抬起眼睛。黑暗中瞧见在那茅棚的洞口显出一只大狗头。</P>

    原来那是一个狗窝。</P>

    他自己本是胆大力壮，猛不可当的人，他拿起他的棍子，当作武器，拿着布袋当作藤牌，慢慢地从那狗窝里爬了出来，只是他那身褴褛的衣服已变得更加破烂了。</P>

    他又走出花园，逼得朝后退出去，运用棍术教师们所谓“盖蔷薇”的那种棍法去招架那条恶狗。</P>

    他费尽力气，越过木栅栏，回到了街心，孤零零，没有栖身之所，没有避风雨的地方，连那堆麦秸和那个不堪的狗窝也不容他涉足，他就让自己落（不是坐）在一块石头上，有个过路人仿佛听见他骂道：“我连狗也不如了！”</P>

    不久，他又立起来，往前走。他出了城，希望能在田野中找到一棵树或是一个干草堆，可以靠一下。</P>

    他那样走了一段时间，老低着头。直到他感到自己已和那些人家离得远了，他才抬起眼睛，四面张望。他已到了田野中，在他前面，有一片矮丘，丘上覆着齐地割了的麦茬，那矮丘在收获之后就象推光了的头一样。</P>

    天边已全黑了，那不仅是夜间的黑暗，仿佛还有极低的云层，压在那一片矮丘上面，继又渐渐浮起，满布天空。但是，由于月亮正待上来，穹苍中也还留着一点暮色的余辉，浮云朵朵，在天空构成了一种乳白的圆顶，一线微光从那顶上反照下来。</P>

    因此地面反比天空显得稍亮一些，那是一种特别阴森的景色，那片矮丘的轮廓，荒凉枯瘦，被黑暗的天边衬托得模糊难辨，色如死灰。所有这一切都是丑恶、卑陋、黯淡、无意义的。在那片田野中和矮丘上，空无所有，只见一棵不成形的树，在和这个流浪人相距几步的地方，蜷曲着它的枝干，摇曳不定。</P>

    显然，这个人在智慧方面和精神方面都谈不上有那些细腻的习气，因而对事物的神秘现象也就无动于衷；可是当时，在那样的天空中，那样的矮丘上，那样的原野里，那样的树杪头，却有一种惊心动魄的凄凉意味，因此他在凝神伫立一阵以后，也就猛然折回头走了。有些人的本能常使他们感到自然界是含有恶意的。</P>

    他顺着原路回去。迪涅的城门都已关上了。迪涅城在宗教战争①中受过围攻，直到一八一五年，它周围还有那种加建了方形碉楼的旧城墙，日后才被拆毁。他便经过那样一个缺口回到城里。 </P>

    ①指十六世纪中叶法国新旧两派宗教进行的战争。</P>

    当时应已是晚上八点钟了，因为他不认识街道，他只得信步走去。他这样走到了省长公署，过后又到了教士培养所。在经过天主堂广场时，他狠狠地对着天主堂扬起了拳头。</P>

    在那广场角上有个印刷局。从前拿破仑在厄尔巴岛上亲自口授，继又带回大陆的诏书及《羽林军告军人书》便是在这个印刷局里第一次排印的。</P>

    他已经困惫不堪，也不再希望什么，便走到那印刷局门前的石凳上躺下来。</P>

    恰巧有个老妇人从那天主堂里出来，她看见这个人躺在黑暗里，便说：</P>

    “您在这儿干什么，朋友？”</P>

    他气冲冲地、粗暴地回答说：</P>

    “您瞧见的，老太婆，我在睡觉。”</P>

    那老太婆，确也当得起这个称呼，她是R侯爵夫人。</P>

    “睡在这石凳上吗？”她又问。</P>

    “我已经睡了十九年的木板褥子，”那人说，“今天要来睡睡石板褥子了。”</P>

    “您当过兵吗？”</P>

    “是呀，老太婆。当过兵。”</P>

    “您为什么不到客栈里去？”</P>

    “因为我没有钱。”</P>

    “唉！”R夫人说，“我荷包里也只有四个苏。”</P>

    “给我就是。”</P>

    那人拿了那四个苏。R夫人继续说：</P>

    “这一点钱，不够您住客栈。不过您去试过没有？您总不能就这样过夜呀。您一定又饿又冷。也许会有人做好事，让您住一宵。”</P>

    “所有的门我都敲过了。”</P>

    “怎样呢？”</P>

    “没有一个地方不把我撵走。”</P>

    “老太婆”推着那人的胳膊，把广场对面主教院旁边的一所矮房子指给他看。</P>

    “所有的门，”她又说，“您都敲过了？”</P>

    “敲过了。”</P>

    “敲过那扇没有呢？”</P>

    “没有。”</P>

    “去敲那扇去。”</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 2 Prudence counselled to Wisdom

    That evening, the Bishop of D----, after his promenade through the town, remained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great work on Duties, which was never completed, unfortunately. He was carefully compiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject. His book was divided into two parts: firstly, the duties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to the class to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties. There are four of these. Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards God (Matt. vi.); duties towards one's self (Matt. v. 29, 30); duties towards one's neighbor (Matt. vii. 12); duties towards animals (Matt. vi. 20, 25). As for the other duties the Bishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in the Epistle to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to young men, by Saint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants, in the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle to the Hebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. Out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole, which he desired to present to souls. </P>

    At eight o'clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on his knees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get the silver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop, knowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probably waiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered the dining-room. </P>

    The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had a door opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on the garden. </P>

    Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the table. </P>

    As she performed this service, she was conversing with Mademoiselle Baptistine. </P>

    A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood fire was burning there. </P>

    One can easily picture to one's self these two women, both of whom were over sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious; Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant, and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady. Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with large, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks, knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles. Mademoiselle Baptistine's gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons. She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig. Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip, which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look. So long as Monseigneur held his peace, she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom; but as soon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, she obeyed passively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even speak. She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him. She had never been pretty, even when she was young; she had large, blue, prominent eyes, and a long arched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person, breathed forth an ineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning. She had always been predestined to gentleness; but faith, charity, hope, those three virtues which mildly warm the soul, had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity. Nature had made her a lamb, religion had made her an angel. Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which has vanished! </P>

    Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening, that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details. </P>

    At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking with considerable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was also accustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door. </P>

    It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, Madame Magloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because there was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injure each other by making things happen. It behooved wise people to play the part of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and care must be taken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and to fasten the doors well. </P>

    Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just come from his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in front of the fire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of other things. He did not take up the remark dropped with design by Madame Magloire. She repeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine, desirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother, ventured to say timidly:-- </P>

    "Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?" </P>

    "I have heard something of it in a vague way," replied the Bishop. Then half-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grew joyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,--"Come, what is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any great danger?" </P>

    Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, a bare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that moment in the town. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre's to obtain lodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in. He had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about the streets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face. </P>

    "Really!" said the Bishop. </P>

    This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemed to her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed; she pursued triumphantly:-- </P>

    "Yes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort of catastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, the police is so badly regulated" (a useful repetition). "The idea of living in a mountainous country, and not even having lights in the streets at night! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! And I say, Monseigneur, and Mademoiselle there says with me--" </P>

    "I," interrupted his sister, "say nothing. What my brother does is well done." </P>

    Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:-- </P>

    "We say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur will permit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only the work of a moment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first passer-by; and I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, if only for this night; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying `come in'; and besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu! there is no need to ask permission." </P>

    At that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door. </P>

    "Come in," said the Bishop.</P>

    那天晚上，迪涅的主教先生从城里散步回来，便关上房门，在自己屋子里一径待到相当晚的时候。当时他正对“义务”问题进行一种巨大的著述工作，可惜没有完成。他起初要把从前那些神甫和博士们就这一严重问题发表过的言论细心清理出来。他的著作分两部分；第一部分是大众的义务，第二部分是各个阶层中个人的义务。大众的义务是重要义务。共分四种。根据圣马太的指示，分作对天主的义务（《马太福音》第六章），对自己的义务（《马太福音》第五章第二十九、三十节），对他人的义务（《马太福音》第七章第十二节），对众生的义务（《马太福音》第六章第二十、二十五节），关于其他各种义务，主教又在旁的地方搜集了一些关于其他各种义务的指示和规定，人主和臣民的义务，在《罗马人书》里；官吏、妻子、母亲、青年男子的义务，是圣保罗明定了的；丈夫、父亲、孩童、仆婢的义务，在《以弗所书》里；信徒的义务，在《希伯来书》里；闺女的义务，在《哥林多书》里。他正苦心孤诣地着手把所有这些条规编成一个协调的整体，供世人阅读。</P>

    八点钟他还在工作，当马格洛大娘按平日习惯到他床边壁柜里去取银器时，他正在一张小方纸上勉强写着字，因为他膝头上正摊着一本碍手碍脚的厚书。过了一会，主教觉得餐具已经摆好，他的妹子也许在等待，他才阖上书本，起身走进餐室。</P>

    那餐室是一间长方形的屋子，有个壁炉，门对着街（我们已经说过），窗子对着花园。</P>

    马格洛大娘刚刚把餐具摆好。</P>

    她尽管忙于工作，却仍和巴狄斯丁姑娘聊天。</P>

    桌子靠近壁炉，桌上放了一盏灯。炉里正燃着相当大的火。</P>

    我们不难想见那两个都已年逾六十的妇人：马格洛大娘矮小、肥胖、活跃，巴狄斯丁姑娘温和、瘦削、脆弱，比她哥稍高一点，穿件蚤色绸袍，那是一八○六年流行的颜色，是她那年在巴黎买的，一径保存到现在。如果我们用粗俗的字眼来说（有些思想往往写上一页还说不清楚，可是单用一个俗字便可表达出来），马格洛大娘的神气象个“村婆”，巴狄斯丁姑娘却象“夫人”。马格洛大娘戴顶白楞边帽，颈上挂个小金十字，算是这家里独一无二的首饰了。她身穿玄青粗呢袍，袖子宽而短，领口里露出一条雪白的围脖，一根绿带子拦腰束住一条红绿方块花纹的棉布围裙，外加一块同样布料的胸巾，用别针扣住上面的两只角，脚上穿双马赛妇女穿的那种大鞋和黄袜。巴狄斯丁姑娘的袍子是照一八○六年的式样裁剪的，上身短，腰围紧，双肩高耸，盘花扣绊。她用一顶幼童式的波状假发遮着自己的斑白头发。马格洛大娘的神气是伶俐、活泼、善良的，她的两只嘴角，一高一低，上唇厚，下唇薄，使她显得怫郁和躁急。只要主教不说话，她总用一种恭敬而又不拘形迹的态度和他谈个不休；主教一开口，她又和那位姑娘一样，服服帖帖唯命是从了，这是大家都见过的。巴狄斯丁姑娘连话也不说。她谨守在听命与承欢的范围以内。即使是少年时期她也并不漂亮，她的蓝眼睛鼓齐面部，鼻子长而曲；但是她的整个面庞和整个人都含有一种说不出的贤淑气度，那是我们在开始时谈过的，她生性仁厚，而信仰、慈悲、愿望，这三种使心灵温暖的美德又渐渐把那种仁厚升为圣德了。她天生就是一头驯羊，宗教却已使她成为天使。可怜的圣女！不可复得的甘美的回忆！</P>

    巴狄斯丁姑娘曾把当天晚上发生在主教院里的那些事对人传述过无数次，以致几个现在还活着的人都还记得极其详尽。</P>

    主教先生走进来时，马格洛大娘正在兴高采烈地说着话。她正和“姑娘”谈着一个她所熟悉而主教也听惯了的问题，那就是关于大门的门闩问题。</P>

    好象是马格洛大娘在买晚餐食料时，在好几处听见了许多话。大家说来了一个奇形怪状的宵小，一个形迹可疑的恶棍，他大约已到了城里的某个地方，今晚打算深夜回家的人也许会遭殃，而且警务又办得很坏，省长和市长又互不相容，彼此都想惹出一些事故，好嫁祸于人。所以聪明人只有自己负起警察的责任，好好地保护自己，并且应当小心，把各人的房子好好地关起，闩起，堵塞起来，尤其要好好地把各人的房门关上。</P>

    马格洛大娘把最后那句话说得格外响些，但是主教从他那间冷冰冰的屋子里走进来坐在壁炉面前烤着火，又想着旁的事了。他没有让马格洛大娘刚才说的话产生影响。她只得再说一遍，于是巴狄斯丁姑娘为了想救马格洛大娘的面子而又不触犯阿哥，便冒着险，轻轻说道：</P>

    “哥，您听见马格洛大娘说的话没有？”</P>

    “我多少听见了一点。”主教回答说。</P>

    随后，他把椅子转过一半，两手放在膝上，炉火也正从下面照着他那副笑容可掬的诚恳面孔，他抬起头对着那年老的女仆说：</P>

    “好好的。有什么事？有什么事？难道我们有什么大不了的危险？”</P>

    于是马格洛大娘又把整个故事从头说起，无意中也不免稍稍说得过火一些。据说有一个游民，一个赤脚大汉，一个恶叫化子这时已到了城里。他到过雅甘·拉巴尔家里去求宿，拉巴尔不肯收留他，有人看见他沿着加桑第大路走来，在街上迷雾里荡来荡去。他是一个有袋子、有绳子、面孔凶恶的人。</P>

    “真的吗？”主教说。</P>

    他既肯向她探问，马格洛大娘自然更起劲了，在她看来，这好象表明主教已有意戒备了，她洋洋得意地追着说：“是呀，主教。是这样的。今天晚上城里一定要出乱子。大家都这样说。加以警务又办得那样坏（这是值得再提到的）。住在山区里，到了夜里，衔上连路灯也没有！出了门就是一个黑洞。我说过，主教，那边的姑娘也这样说……”</P>

    “我，”妹子岔着说，“我没有意见。我哥做的事总是好的。”</P>

    马格洛大娘仍继续说下去，好象没有人反对过她似的：</P>

    “我们说这房子一点也不安全，如果主教准许，我就去找普兰·缪斯博瓦铜匠，要他来把从前那些铁门闩重新装上去，那些东西都在，不过是一分钟的事，我还要说，主教，就是为了今天这一夜也应当有铁门闩，因为，我说，一扇只有活闩的门，随便什么人都可以从外面开进来，再没有比这更可怕的事了，加以主教平素总是让人随意进出，况且，就是在夜半，呵，我的天主！也不用先得许可……”</P>

    这时，有人在门上敲了一下，并且敲得相当凶。</P>

    “请进来。”主教说。</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 3 The Heroism of Passive Obedience

    The door opened. </P>

    It opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given it an energetic and resolute push. </P>

    A man entered. </P>

    We already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter. </P>

    He entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behind him. He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel in his hand, a rough, audacious, weary, and violent expression in his eyes. The fire on the hearth lighted him up. He was hideous. It was a sinister apparition. </P>

    Madame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry. She trembled, and stood with her mouth wide open. </P>

    Mademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and half started up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face became once more profoundly calm and serene. </P>

    The Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man. </P>

    As he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the new-comer what he desired, the man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old man and the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, he said, in a loud voice:-- </P>

    "See here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys. I have passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four days ago, and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. I have been walking for four days since I left Toulon. I have travelled a dozen leagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived in these parts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport, which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to an inn. They said to me, `Be off,' at both places. No one would take me. I went to the prison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a dog's kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a man. One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the fields, intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There were no stars. I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the town, to seek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant to sleep on a stone bench. A good woman pointed out your house to me, and said to me, `Knock there!' I have knocked. What is this place? Do you keep an inn? I have money--savings. One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the course of nineteen years. I will pay. What is that to me? I have money. I am very weary; twelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry. Are you willing that I should remain?" </P>

    "Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "you will set another place." </P>

    The man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was on the table. "Stop," he resumed, as though he had not quite understood; "that's not it. Did you hear? I am a galley-slave; a convict. I come from the galleys." He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper, which he unfolded. "Here's my passport. Yellow, as you see. This serves to expel me from every place where I go. Will you read it? I know how to read. I learned in the galleys. There is a school there for those who choose to learn. Hold, this is what they put on this passport: `Jean Valjean, discharged convict, native of'--that is nothing to you--`has been nineteen years in the galleys: five years for house-breaking and burglary; fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions. He is a very dangerous man.' There! Every one has cast me out. Are you willing to receive me? Is this an inn? Will you give me something to eat and a bed? Have you a stable?" </P>

    "Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove." We have already explained the character of the two women's obedience. </P>

    Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders. </P>

    The Bishop turned to the man. </P>

    "Sit down, sir, and warm yourself. We are going to sup in a few moments, and your bed will be prepared while you are supping." </P>

    At this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression of his face, up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of stupefaction, of doubt, of joy, and became extraordinary. He began stammering like a crazy man:-- </P>

    "Really? What! You will keep me? You do not drive me forth? A convict! You call me sir! You do not address me as thou? `Get out of here, you dog!' is what people always say to me. I felt sure that you would expel me, so I told you at once who I am. Oh, what a good woman that was who directed me hither! I am going to sup! A bed with a mattress and sheets, like the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years since I have slept in a bed! You actually do not want me to go! You are good people. Besides, I have money. I will pay well. Pardon me, monsieur the inn-keeper, but what is your name? I will pay anything you ask. You are a fine man. You are an inn-keeper, are you not?" </P>

    "I am," replied the Bishop, "a priest who lives here." </P>

    "A priest!" said the man. "Oh, what a fine priest! Then you are not going to demand any money of me? You are the cure, are you not? the cure of this big church? Well! I am a fool, truly! I had not perceived your skull-cap." </P>

    As he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner, replaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself. Mademoiselle Baptistine gazed mildly at him. He continued: "You are humane, Monsieur le Cure; you have not scorned me. A good priest is a very good thing. Then you do not require me to pay?" </P>

    "No," said the Bishop; "keep your money. How much have you? Did you not tell me one hundred and nine francs?" </P>

    "And fifteen sous," added the man. </P>

    "One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous. And how long did it take you to earn that?" </P>

    "Nineteen years." </P>

    "Nineteen years!" </P>

    The Bishop sighed deeply. </P>

    The man continued: "I have still the whole of my money. In four days I have spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned by helping unload some wagons at Grasse. Since you are an abbe, I will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys. And one day I saw a bishop there. Monseigneur is what they call him. He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He is the cure who rules over the other cures, you understand. Pardon me, I say that very badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me! You understand what we are! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on an altar. He had a pointed thing, made of gold, on his head; it glittered in the bright light of midday. We were all ranged in lines on the three sides, with cannons with lighted matches facing us. We could not see very well. He spoke; but he was too far off, and we did not hear. That is what a bishop is like." </P>

    While he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which had remained wide open. </P>

    Madame Magloire returned. She brought a silver fork and spoon, which she placed on the table. </P>

    "Madame Magloire," said the Bishop, "place those things as near the fire as possible." And turning to his guest: "The night wind is harsh on the Alps. You must be cold, sir." </P>

    Each time that he uttered the word sir, in his voice which was so gently grave and polished, the man's face lighted up. Monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the Medusa. Ignominy thirsts for consideration. </P>

    "This lamp gives a very bad light," said the Bishop. </P>

    Madame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur's bed-chamber, and placed them, lighted, on the table. </P>

    "Monsieur le Cure," said the man, "you are good; you do not despise me. You receive me into your house. You light your candles for me. Yet I have not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunate man." </P>

    The Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. "You could not help telling me who you were. This is not my house; it is the house of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you are hungry and thirsty; you are welcome. And do not thank me; do not say that I receive you in my house. No one is at home here, except the man who needs a refuge. I say to you, who are passing by, that you are much more at home here than I am myself. Everything here is yours. What need have I to know your name? Besides, before you told me you had one which I knew." </P>

    The man opened his eyes in astonishment. </P>

    "Really? You knew what I was called?" </P>

    "Yes," replied the Bishop, "you are called my brother." </P>

    "Stop, Monsieur le Cure," exclaimed the man. "I was very hungry when I entered here; but you are so good, that I no longer know what has happened to me." </P>

    The Bishop looked at him, and said,-- </P>

    "You have suffered much?" </P>

    "Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat, cold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing, the cell for one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain! Dogs, dogs are happier! Nineteen years! I am forty-six. Now there is the yellow passport. That is what it is like." </P>

    "Yes," resumed the Bishop, "you have come from a very sad place. Listen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts of good-will and of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us." </P>

    In the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made with water, oil, bread, and salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, a fresh cheese, and a large loaf of rye bread. She had, of her own accord, added to the Bishop's ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves wine. </P>

    The Bishop's face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures. "To table!" he cried vivaciously. As was his custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on his right. Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable and natural, took her seat at his left. </P>

    The Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according to his custom. The man began to eat with avidity. </P>

    All at once the Bishop said: "It strikes me there is something missing on this table." </P>

    Madame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks and spoons which were absolutely necessary. Now, it was the usage of the house, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the table-cloth--an innocent ostentation. </P>

    This graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child's play, which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household, which raised poverty into dignity. </P>

    Madame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word, and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by the Bishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table.</P>

    门开了。</P>

    门一下子便大大地开了，好象有人使了大劲和决心推它似的。</P>

    有个人进来了。</P>

    这人我们已经认识，便是我们刚才见过，往来求宿的那个过路人。</P>

    他走进来，向前踏上一步，停住，让门在他背后敞着。他的肩上有个布袋，手里有根木棍，眼睛里有种粗鲁、放肆、困惫和强暴的神情。壁炉里的火正照着他，他那样子真是凶恶可怕，简直是恶魔的化身。</P>

    马格洛大娘连叫喊的力气都没有了。她大吃一惊，变得目瞪口呆。</P>

    巴狄斯丁姑娘回头瞧见那人朝门里走，吓得站不直身子，过了一会才慢慢地转过头去，对着壁炉，望着她哥，她的面色又转成深沉恬静的了。</P>

    主教用镇静的目光瞧着那人。</P>

    他正要开口问那新来的人需要什么，那人双手靠在他的棍上，把老人和两个妇人来回地看着，不等主教开口，便大声说：</P>

    “请听我说。我叫冉阿让。我是个苦役犯。在监牢里过了十九年。出狱四天了，现在我要去蓬塔利埃，那是我的目的地。我从土伦走来，已经走了四天了，我今天一天就走了十二法里。天黑时才到这地方，我到过一家客店，只因为我在市政厅请验了黄护照，就被人赶了出来。那又是非请验不可的。我又走到另外一家客店。他们对我说：‘滚！’这家不要我。那家也不要我。我又到了监狱，看门的人也不肯开门。我也到过狗窝。那狗咬了我，也把我撵了出来，好象它也是人似的，好象它也知道我是谁似的。我就跑到田里，打算露天过一宵。可是天上没有星。我想天要下雨了，又没有好天主阻挡下雨，我再回到城里，想找个门洞。那边，在那空地里，有一块石板，我正躺下去，一个婆婆把您这房子指给我瞧，对我说：‘您去敲敲那扇门。’我已经敲过了。这是什么地方？是客店吗？我有钱。我有积蓄。一百○九个法郎十五个苏，我在监牢里用十九年的工夫作工赚来的。可以付账。那有什么关系？我有钱。我困极了，走了十二法里，我饿得很。您肯让我歇下吗？”</P>

    “马格洛大娘，”主教说，“加一副刀叉。”</P>

    那人走了三步，靠近台上的那盏灯。“不是，”他说，仿佛他没有听懂似的，“不是这个意思。您听见了没有？我是一个苦役犯，一个罚作苦役的罪犯。我是刚从牢里出来的。”他从衣袋里抽出一张大黄纸，展开说：“这就是我的护照。黄的，您瞧。这东西害我处处受人撵。您要念吗？我能念，我，我在牢里念过书。那里有个学校，愿意读书的人都可以进去。您听吧，这就是写在纸上的话：‘冉阿让，苦役犯，刑满释放，原籍……’您不一定要知道我是什么地方人，‘处狱中凡十九年。计穿墙行窃，五年。四次企图越狱，十四年。为人异常险狠。’就这样！大家都把我撵出来，您肯收留我吗？您这是客店吗？您肯给我吃，给我睡吗？您有一间马房没有？”</P>

    “马格洛大娘，”主教说，“您在壁厢里的床上铺上一条白床单。”</P>

    我们已解释过那两个妇人的服从性是怎样的。</P>

    马格洛大娘即刻出去执行命令。</P>

    主教转过身来，朝着那人。</P>

    “先生，请坐，烤烤火。等一会儿，我们就吃晚饭，您吃着的时候，您的床也就会预备好的。”</P>

    到这时，那人才完全懂了。他的那副一向阴沉严肃的面孔显出惊讶、疑惑和欢乐，变得很奇特，他好象一个疯子，低声慢气地说：</P>

    “真的吗？怎么？您留我吗？您不撵我走！一个苦役犯！您叫我做‘先生’！和我说话，您不用‘你’字。‘滚！狗东西！’人家总那样叫我。我还以为您一定会撵我走呢。并且我一上来就说明我是谁。呵！那个好婆婆，她把这地方告诉了我。我有晚饭吃了！有床睡了！一张有褥子、垫单的床！和旁人一样！十九年我没有睡在床上了，您当真不要我走！您是有天良的人！并且我有钱。我自然要付账的。对不起，客店老板先生，您贵姓？随便您要多少，我都照付。您是个好人。您是客店老板，不是吗？”</P>

    “我是一个住在此地的神甫。”主教说。</P>

    “一个神甫！”那人说。“呵，好一个神甫！那么您不要我的钱吗？本堂神甫，是吗？那个大教堂里的本堂神甫。对呀！真是，我多么蠢，我刚才还没有注意看您的小帽子！”</P>

    他一面说，一面把布袋和棍子放在屋角里，随后又把护照插进衣袋，然后坐下去，巴狄斯丁姑娘和蔼地瞧着他。他继续说：</P>

    “您是有人道的，本堂神甫先生。您没有瞧不起人的心。一个好神甫真是好。那么您不要我付账吗？”“不用付账，”主教说，“留着您的钱吧。您有多少？您没有说过一百○九个法郎吗？”</P>

    “还得加上十五个苏。”那人说。</P>

    “一百○九个法郎十五个苏。您花了多少时间赚来的？”</P>

    “十九年。”</P>

    “十九年！”</P>

    主教深深地叹了一口气。</P>

    那人接着说：</P>

    “我的钱，全都在。这四天里我只用了二十五个苏，那二十五个苏是我在格拉斯地方帮着卸车上的货物赚来的。您既是神甫，我就得和您说，从前在我们牢里有个布道神甫。一天，我又看见一个主教。大家都称他做‘主教大人’。那是马赛马若尔教堂的主教。他是一些神甫头上的神甫。请您原谅，您知道，我不会说话；对我来说，实在说不好！您知道，象我们这种人！他在监狱里一个祭台上做过弥撒，头上有个尖的金玩意儿。在中午的阳光里，那玩意几照得多么亮。我们一行行排着，三面围着。在我们的前面，有许多大炮，引火绳子也点着了。我们看不大清楚。他对我们讲话，但是他站得太靠里了，我们听不见。那样就是一个主教。”</P>

    他谈着，主教走去关上那扇敞着的门。</P>

    马格洛大娘又进来，拿着一套餐具，摆在桌子上。“马格洛大娘，”主教说，“您把这套餐具摆在靠近火的地方。”他又转过去朝着他的客人：</P>

    “阿尔卑斯山里的夜风是够受的。先生，您大约很冷吧？”</P>

    每次他用他那种柔和严肃、诚意待客的声音说出“先生”那两个字时，那人总是喜形于色。“先生”对于罪犯，正象一杯水对于墨杜萨①的遭难音。蒙羞的人都渴望别人的尊重。</P>

    “这盏灯，”主教说，“太不亮了。” </P>

    ①墨杜萨（Méduse），船名，一八一六年七月二日在距非洲西岸四十海里地方遇险。一百四十九个旅客改乘木排，在海上飘了十二天，旅客多因饥渴死去。得救者十五人。</P>

    马格洛大娘会意，走到主教的卧室里，从壁炉上拿了那两个银烛台，点好放在桌上。</P>

    “神甫先生，”那人说，“您真好。您并不瞧不起我。您让我住在您的家里，您为我点起蜡烛。我并没有瞒您我是从什么地方来的，也没有瞒您我是一个倒霉蛋。”</P>

    主教坐在他身旁，轻轻按着他的手。</P>

    “您不用向我说您是谁。这并不是我的房子，这是耶稣基督的房子。这扇门并不问走进来的人有没有名字，但是要问他是否有痛苦。您有痛苦，您又饿又渴，您安心待下吧。并且不应当谢我，不应当说我把您留在我的家里。除非是需要住处的人，谁也不是在自己家里。您是过路的人，我告诉您，与其说我是在我的家里，倒不如说您是在您的家里。这儿所有的东西都是您的。我为什么要知道您的名字呢？并且在您把您的名字告诉我以前，您已经有了一个名字，是我早知道了的。”</P>

    那个人睁圆了眼，有些莫名其妙。</P>

    “真的吗？您早已知道我的名字吗？”</P>

    “对，”主教回答说，“您的名字叫‘我的兄弟’。”</P>

    “真怪，神甫先生，”那人叫着说，“我进来时肚子是真饿，但是您这么好，我已经不知道饿了，我已经不饿了。”</P>

    主教望着他，向他说：</P>

    “您很吃过一些苦吧？”</P>

    “穿红衣，脚上拖铁球，睡觉只有一块木板，受热，受冷，做苦工，编到苦囚队里，挨棍子！没有一点事也得拖上夹链条。说错一个字就关黑屋子。病在床上也得拖着链子，狗，狗还快乐些呢！十九年！我已经四十六岁了。现在还得带张黄护照，就这样。”</P>

    “是呀，”主教说，“您是从苦地方出来的。您听吧。一个流着泪忏悔的罪人在天上所得的快乐，比一百个穿白衣的善人还更能获得上天的喜爱呢。您从那个苦地方出来，如果还有愤怒憎恨别人的心，那您真是值得可怜的；如果您怀着善心、仁爱、和平的思想，那您就比我们中的任何人都还高贵些。”</P>

    马格洛大娘把晚餐开出来了。一盆用白开水、植物油、面包和盐做的汤，还有一点咸肉、一块羊肉、无花果、新鲜乳酪和一大块黑麦面包。她在主教先生的日常食物之外，主动加了一瓶陈年母福酒。</P>

    主教的脸上忽然起了好客的人所特有的那种愉快神情。</P>

    “请坐。”他连忙说。如同平日留客晚餐一样，他请那人坐在他的右边，巴狄斯丁姑娘，完全宁静自如，坐在他的左边。</P>

    主教依照他的习惯，先做祷告，再亲手分汤。那人贪婪地吃起来。</P>

    主教忽然说：“桌上好象少了一件东西。”</P>

    马格洛大娘的确没有摆上那三副绝不可少的餐具。照这一家人的习惯，主教留客晚餐时，总得在台布上陈设上那六份银器，这其实是一种可有可无的陈设。那种温雅的假奢华是这一家人的一种饶有情趣的稚气，把清寒的景象提高到富华的气派。</P>

    马格洛大娘领会到他的意思，一声不响，走了出去，不大一会，主教要的那三副食具，在三位进餐人的面前齐齐整整地摆出来了，在台布上面闪闪发光。</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 4 Details concerning the Cheese-Dairies of Pontarlier

    Now, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, we cannot do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of Mademoiselle Baptistine's letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein the conversation between the convict and the Bishop is described with ingenious minuteness.</P>

    ". . . This man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the voracity of a starving man. However, after supper he said:</P>

    "`Monsieur le Cure of the good God, all this is far too good for me; but I must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep a better table than you do.'</P>

    "Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me. My brother replied:-</P>

    "`They are more fatigued than I.'</P>

    "`No,' returned the man, `they have more money. You are poor; I see that plainly. You cannot be even a curate. Are you really a cure? Ah, if the good God were but just, you certainly ought to be a cure!'</P>

    "`The good God is more than just,' said my brother.</P>

    "A moment later he added:--</P>

    "`Monsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you are going?'</P>

    "`With my road marked out for me.'</P>

    "I think that is what the man said. Then he went on:--</P>

    "`I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling is hard. If the nights are cold, the days are hot.'</P>

    "`You are going to a good country,' said my brother. `During the Revolution my family was ruined. I took refuge in Franche-Comte at first, and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands. My will was good. I found plenty to occupy me. One has only to choose. There are paper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watch factories on a large scale, steel mills, copper works, twenty iron foundries at least, four of which, situated at Lods, at Chatillon, at Audincourt, and at Beure, are tolerably large.'</P>

    "I think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my brother mentioned. Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:--</P>

    "`Have we not some relatives in those parts, my dear sister?'</P>

    "I replied,--</P>

    "`We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain of the gates at Pontarlier under the old regime.'</P>

    "`Yes,' resumed my brother; `but in '93, one had no longer any relatives, one had only one's arms. I worked. They have, in the country of Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister. It is their cheese-dairies, which they call fruitieres.'</P>

    "Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, with great minuteness, what these fruitieres of Pontarlier were; that they were divided into two classes: the big barns which belong to the rich, and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the associated fruitieres, which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who hold their cows in common, and share the proceeds. `They engage the services of a cheese-maker, whom they call the grurin; the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks the quantity on a double tally. It is towards the end of April that the work of the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June that the cheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.'</P>

    "The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink that good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says that wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin, as though he wished the man to understand, without advising him directly and harshly, that this would afford him a refuge. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my brother utter a single word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when he entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my brother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that a mark of the passage might remain behind. This might have appeared to any one else who had this, unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body, and to bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned with moralizing and advice, or a little commiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future. My brother did not even ask him from what country he came, nor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault, and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it. To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise a gentle labor near heaven, and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint of reflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my brother's heart. He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing was to divert him from it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily, that he was a person like any other, by treating him just in his ordinary way. Is not this indeed, to understand charity well? Is there not, dear Madame, something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon, from moralizing, from allusions? and is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all? It has seemed to me that this might have been my brother's private thought. In any case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he gave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same as he is every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with M. Gedeon le Provost, or with the curate of the parish.</P>

    "Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock at the door. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My brother kissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I had about me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was not paying much heed to anything then. He was no longer talking, and he seemed very much fatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my brother said grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, `You must be in great need of your bed.' Madame Magloire cleared the table very promptly. I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep, and we both went up stairs. Nevertheless, I sent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the man's bed a goat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights are frigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity that this skin is old; all the hair is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in Germany, at Tottlingen, near the sources of the Danube, as well as the little ivory-handled knife which I use at table.</P>

    "Madame Magloire returned immediately. We said our prayers in the drawing-room, where we hang up the linen, and then we each retired to our own chambers, without saying a word to each other."</P>

    现在，为了把那餐桌上经过的事大致地说一说，最好是把巴狄斯丁姑娘写给波瓦舍佛隆夫人的信中的一段抄下来，那苦役犯和主教的谈话，在那上面都有了坦率而细致的叙述。</P>

    “……那人对谁也不注意。他饿鬼似的贪婪地吃着。吃完汤以后，他说：</P>

    “‘慈悲上帝的神甫先生，这一切东西对我来说还确确实实是太好了，但是我得说，不肯和我一道吃饭的那些车夫比您还吃得好些呢。’</P>

    “说句私话，我觉得这种观察有些刺耳。我哥答道：</P>

    “‘他们要比我疲劳些。’</P>

    “‘不，’那人接着说，‘他们的钱多些。您穷。我看得出来。您也许连本堂神甫也还不是吧。您只是一个普通神甫吧？岂有此理，如果慈悲上帝是公平的话，您理应当个神甫。’</P>

    “‘公平两字远远不能全部表达慈悲上帝的好处。’我哥说。</P>

    “过了一会，他又说：</P>

    “‘冉阿让先生，您是要到蓬塔利埃去吗？’</P>

    “‘那是指定的路程。’</P>

    “我想他一定是那样说的。随后他接着说：</P>

    “‘明天一早我就得动身。这段路是很难走的。晚上冷，白天却很热。’</P>

    “‘您去的地方倒是个好地方，’我哥说，‘在革命时期我家破了产，起初我躲在法兰什·康地，靠自己的两条胳膊作工度日。我的毅力好。在那里我找到许多工作，只要我们肯选择。有造纸厂、制革广、蒸馏厂、榨油厂、大规模的钟表制造厂、炼钢厂、炼铜厂，铁工厂就至少有二十个，其中四个在洛兹、夏蒂荣、奥当库尔和白尔，这些厂都是很大的。’</P>

    “我想我没有搞错吧，我哥说的几个名字一定就是那几个了，随后他自己又把话打断，对我说：</P>

    “‘亲爱的妹子，我们有些亲戚住在那里吗？’</P>

    “我回答说：</P>

    “‘我们从前有过的，在那些亲戚里有德·吕司内先生，革命以前，他是蓬塔利埃的卫戍司令。’</P>

    “‘对的，’我哥接着说，‘但到了九三年大家都没有亲戚了，都只靠自己的两只手。我做过工。在蓬塔利埃，您，冉阿让先生，将要去的那地方，有一种历史悠久而极有趣的实业，我的妹妹，这就是他们叫做果品厂的那些乳酪厂。’</P>

    “于是我哥一面劝那人吃，一面把篷塔利埃果品厂的内容非常详细地说给他听。厂分两种，‘大仓’是富人的，里面有四十或五十头母牛，每个夏季可以产七千到八千个酪饼；还有合作果品厂是穷人的，半山里的乡下人把他们的牛合起来大伙公养，产品也由大伙分享。他们雇用一个制酪工人，管他叫格鲁阑；格鲁阑把各会友的牛乳收下来，每天三次，同时把分量记在双合板上。四月末，乳酪厂的工作开始；六月中，那些制酪工人就把他们的牛牵到山里去了。</P>

    “那人一面吃，一面精神也振作起来了。我哥拿那种好的母福酒给他喝，他自己却不喝，因为他说那种酒贵。我哥带着您所知道的那种怡然自得的愉快神情，把那些琐事讲给他听，谈时还不时露出殷勤的态度。他再三重复说那些格鲁阑的情况良好，好象他既迫切希望那人能懂得那是个安身的好地方，而又感到不便直截了当开导他似的。有件事给了我强烈的印象。那人的来历我已向您说过了，可是，我的哥，在晚餐期间直到就寝前，除了在他刚进门时说了几句关于耶稣的话以外，再也没有说过一个字可以使那人回忆起他自己是谁，也没有一个字可以使那人看出我的哥是谁。在那种场合，似乎很可以告诫他几句，并且可以把主教压在罪犯的头上，暂时给他留下一个印象。如果是别人碰上了这样一个可怜人，他也许会认为，在给以物质食粮的同时，还应当给以精神食粮，不妨在谴责当中附带教训开导一番，或是说些怜惜的话勉励他以后好好做人。我哥却连他的籍贯和历史都没有问。因为在他的历史里，有他的过失，我哥仿佛要避免一切可以使他回忆起那些事的话。他谈到蓬塔利埃的山民，只说他们接近青天，工作舒适。他还说他们快乐，因为他们没有罪过，正说到这儿，他突然停了下来，唯恐他无心说出的那两个字含有可以触犯那人的意思。我仔细想过以后，自信领会了我哥的心思。他心里想，那个叫作冉阿让的人，脑子里苦恼太多了，最好是装出完全没有事的样子，使他感到轻松自在，使他认为他是和旁人一样的一个人。那样，即使只是片刻，也是好的。那岂不是对慈善的最深切的了解吗？我慈祥的夫人，他那样撇开告诫、教训、暗示，岂不是体贴入微，确实高明无比吗？人有痛处，最好的爱护，难道不是绝不去碰它吗？我想这或者就是我哥心里的想法了。无论怎样，我可以说，即使他有过那些心思，却对我也不曾流露过，自然至终，他完全是平时那个人，他那晚和冉阿让进餐，正和他陪着瑞德翁·勒普莱服先生或是总司铎管辖区的司铎进晚餐一样。</P>

    “晚餐快完，大家吃着无花果时，有个人来敲门。那是瑞波妈妈，手里抱着她的小孩。我哥吻了吻那孩子的额头，向我借去身上的十五个苏，给了瑞波妈妈。那人到了这时，已经不大留心，注意力已不怎么集中了。他不再说话，显得非常疲倦。可怜的老瑞波走了以后，我哥念了谢食文，随后又转过身去，向那人说：‘您大概很需要上床休息了。’马格洛大娘赶忙收拾桌子。我知道我们应当走开，让那旅客去休息，两个人便一同上了楼。过了一会，我又派马格洛大娘把我房里的那张黑森林麂子皮送到那人的床上。夜间冰冷，那东西可以御寒。可惜那张皮已经旧了，毛已落光。它是我哥从前住在德国多瑙河发源地附近的多德林根城时买的，我在餐桌上用的那把象牙柄的小刀也是在那地方同时买的。</P>

    “马格洛大娘几乎即刻就上楼来了，我们在晾洗衣服的屋子里祷告了上帝，随后，各自回到自己的房间，没有再谈什么。”</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 5 Tranquillity

    After bidding his sister good night, Monseigneur Bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to his guest, and said to him,--</P>

    "Monsieur, I will conduct you to your room."</P>

    The man followed him.</P>

    As might have been observed from what has been said above, the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated, or to get out of it, it was necessary to traverse the Bishop's bedroom.</P>

    At the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed. This was her last care every evening before she went to bed.</P>

    The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had been prepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table.</P>

    "Well," said the Bishop, "may you pass a good night. To-morrow morning, before you set out, you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows."</P>

    "Thanks, Monsieur l'Abbe," said the man.</P>

    Hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all of a sudden, and without transition, he made a strange movement, which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror, had they witnessed it. Even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment. Did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace? Was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself? He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his arms, and bending upon his host a savage gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse voice:--</P>

    "Ah! really! You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?"</P>

    He broke off, and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous:--</P>

    "Have you really reflected well? How do you know that I have not been an assassin?"</P>

    The Bishop replied:--</P>

    "That is the concern of the good God."</P>

    Then gravely, and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself, he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man, who did not bow, and without turning his head or looking behind him, he returned to his bedroom.</P>

    When the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer. A moment later he was in his garden, walking, meditating, conteplating, his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the eyes which remain open.</P>

    As for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon the bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep.</P>

    Midnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his apartment.</P>

    A few minutes later all were asleep in the little house.</P>

    卞福汝主教和他的妹子道过晚安以后，从桌上拿起一个银烛台，并把另外那一个交给他的客人，说：</P>

    “先生，我来引您到您的房间里去。”</P>

    那人跟着他走。</P>

    我们在上面已经谈到过那所房子的结构形式，到那间有壁厢的祈祷室里去，或是从里面出来，都得经过主教的卧室。</P>

    他们穿过那屋子时，马格洛大娘正把那些银杯盏塞进他床头的壁橱，那是她每晚就寝以前要做的最后一件事。</P>

    主教把他的客人安顿在壁厢里。那里安着一张洁白的床。</P>

    那人把烛台放在一张小桌上。</P>

    “好了，”主教说，“好好唾一晚吧。明天早晨，您在动身以前，再喝一杯我们家里的热牛奶。”</P>

    “谢谢教士先生。”那人说。</P>

    那句极平静的话刚说出口，他忽然加上一个奇怪的动作，假使那两个圣女看见了，她们一定会吓得发呆的。直到现在，我们还难于肯定他当时是受了什么力量的主使。他是要给个警告还是想进行恐吓呢？还是他受了一种连他自己也无法了解的本能的冲动呢？他蓦地转过身来对着那老人，叉起胳膊，用一种凶横的目光望着他的房主，并且粗声地喊道：</P>

    “呀哈！真的吗？您让我睡在离您这样近的地方吗？”</P>

    他又接上一阵狰狞的笑声，说道：</P>

    “您全想清楚了吗？谁向您说我不曾杀过人呢？”</P>

    主教抬起头，望着天花板，回答说：</P>

    “那只干上帝的事。”</P>

    随后，他严肃地动着嘴唇，好象一个做祷告或自言自语的人，伸出他右手的两个指头，为那人祝福，那人并没有低头，他不掉头也不朝后看，就回到自己的屋子里去了。</P>

    壁厢里有人住时，他总把一方大哗叽帷布拉开，遮住神座。主教走过帷布跟前，跪下去做了一回短短的祈祷。过了一会，他到了他的园里，散步。潜思，默想，心灵和思想全寄托在上帝在晚间为所有尚未合眼的人显示的伟大神秘的事物上面。</P>

    至于那人，确是太困了，连那洁白的床单也没有享用，他用鼻孔（这是囚犯们的作法）吹灭了烛，和衣倒在床上，立即睡熟了。</P>

    主教从园中回到他住宅时，钟正敲着十二点。</P>

    几分钟过后，那所小房子里的一切全都睡去了。</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 6 Jean Valjean

    Towards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.</P>

    Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not learned to read in his childhood. When he reached man's estate, be became a tree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; his father was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably a sobriquet, and a contraction of viola Jean, "here's Jean."</P>

    Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole, however, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about Jean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother at a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had not been properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had been killed by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean was a sister older than himself,--a widow with seven children, boys and girls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother.</P>

    The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old. The youngest, one.</P>

    Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the father's place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought him up. This was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill-paid toil. He had never known a "kind woman friend" in his native parts. He had not had the time to fall in love.</P>

    He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word. His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating,--a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the heart of the cabbage,--to give to one of her children. As he went on eating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, not far from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane, a farmer's wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habitually famished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, in their mother's name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their mother had known of this marauding, she would have punished the delinquents severely. Jean Valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude for the pint of milk behind their mother's back, and the children were not punished.</P>

    In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out as a hay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. He did whatever he could. His sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children? It was a sad group enveloped in misery, which was being gradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. Jean had no work. The family had no bread. No bread literally. Seven children!</P>

    One Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square at Faverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the glass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran out in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran after him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but his arm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.</P>

    This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world, he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler, smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remark cursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest, the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest, make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often without destroying the humane side.</P>

    Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were explicit. There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys.</P>

    On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the general-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directory to the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floreal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte, was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaves was put in chains at Bicetre. Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang. An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old, still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth line, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated on the ground like the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position, except that it was horrible. It is probable that he, also, was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant of everything, something excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept, his tears stifled him, they impeded his speech; he only managed to say from time to time, "I was a tree-pruner at Faverolles." Then still sobbing, he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times, as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights, and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done, whatever it was, he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children.</P>

    He set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of twenty-seven days, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he was clothed in the red cassock. All that had constituted his life, even to his name, was effaced; he was no longer even Jean Valjean; he was number 24,601. What became of his sister? What became of the seven children? Who troubled himself about that? What becomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root?</P>

    It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures of God, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge, wandered away at random,--who even knows?-- each in his own direction perhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race. They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their village forgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them; after a few years' residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgot them. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar. That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon, did he hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think, towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity. I know not through what channels the news reached him. Some one who had known them in their own country had seen his sister. She was in Paris. She lived in a poor street Rear Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her only one child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six? Perhaps she did not know herself. Every morning she went to a printing office, No. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she was a folder and stitcher. She was obliged to be there at six o'clock in the morning--long before daylight in winter. In the same building with the printing office there was a school, and to this school she took her little boy, who was seven years old. But as she entered the printing office at six, and the school only opened at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard, for the school to open, for an hour--one hour of a winter night in the open air! They would not allow the child to come into the printing office, because he was in the way, they said. When the workmen passed in the morning, they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement, overcome with drowsiness, and often fast asleep in the shadow, crouched down and doubled up over his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress, took pity on him; she took him into her den, where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs, and the little one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from cold. At seven o'clock the school opened, and he entered. That is what was told to Jean Valjean.</P>

    They talked to him about it for one day; it was a moment, a flash, as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing more forever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheld them; he never met them again; and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more.</P>

    Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean's turn to escape arrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place. He escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,--of a smoking roof, of a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking clock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening of the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime, to a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years. In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself of it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at roll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; he resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This case, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition of five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the tenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he succeeded no better. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years. Finally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, he made a last attempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. In October, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.</P>

    Room for a brief parenthesis. This is the second time, during his studies on the penal question and damnation by law, that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny. Claude Gaux had stolen a loaf; Jean Valjean had stolen a loaf. English statistics prove the fact that four thefts out of five in London have hunger for their immediate cause.</P>

    Jean Valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering; he emerged impassive. He had entered in despair; he emerged gloomy.</P>

    What had taken place in that soul?</P>

    半夜，冉阿让醒了。</P>

    冉阿让生在布里的一个贫农家里。他幼年不识字。成人以后，在法维洛勒做修树枝的工人，他的母亲叫让·马弟，他的父亲叫冉阿让，或让来，让来大致是浑名，也是“阿让来了”的简音。</P>

    冉阿让生来就好用心思，但并不沉郁，那是富于情感的人的特性。但是他多少有些昏昏沉沉、无足轻重的味儿，至少表面如此。他在很小时就失去父母。他的母亲是因为害乳炎，诊治失当死的。他的父亲和他一样，也是个修树枝的工人，从树上摔下来死的。冉阿让只剩一个姐姐，姐姐孀居，有七个子女。把冉阿让抚养成人的就是这个姐姐。丈夫在世时，她一直负担着她小弟弟的膳宿。丈夫死了。七个孩子中最大的一个有八岁，最小的一岁。冉阿让刚到二十五岁，他代行父职，帮助姐姐，报答她当年抚养之恩。那是很自然的事，象一种天职似的，冉阿让甚至做得有些过火。他的青年时期便是那样在干着报酬微薄的辛苦工作中消磨过去的。他家乡的人从来没有听说他有过“女朋友”。他没有时间去想爱情问题。</P>

    他天黑回家，精疲力尽，一言不发，吃他的菜汤。他吃时，他姐姐让妈妈，时常从他的汤瓢里把他食物中最好的一些东西，一块瘦肉，一片肥肉，白菜的心，拿给她的一个孩子吃。他呢，俯在桌上，头几乎浸在汤里，头发垂在瓢边，遮着他的眼睛，只管吃，好象全没看见，让人家拿。</P>

    在法维洛勒的那条小街上，阿让茅屋斜对面的地方，住着一个农家妇女，叫玛丽－克洛德，阿让家的孩子们，挨饿是常事，他们有时冒他们母亲的名，到玛丽－克洛德那里去借一勺牛奶，躲在篱笆后面或路角上喝起来，大家拿那奶罐抢来抢去，使那些小女孩子紧张到泼得身上、颈子上都是奶。母亲如果知道了这种欺诈行为，一定会严厉惩罚这些小骗子的。冉阿让气冲冲，嘴里唠叨不绝，瞒着孩子们的母亲把牛奶钱照付给玛丽－克洛德，他们才没有挨揍。</P>

    在修树枝的季节里，他每天可以赚十八个苏，过后他就替人家当割麦零工、小工、牧牛人、苦工。他做他能做的事。他的姐也作工，但是拖着七个孩子怎么办呢？那是一群苦恼的人，穷苦把他们逐渐围困起来。有一年冬季，冉阿让找不到工作。</P>

    家里没有面包。绝对没有一点面包，却有七个孩子。</P>

    住在法维洛勒的天主堂广场上的面包店老板穆伯·易查博，一个星期日的晚上正预备去睡时，忽听得有人在他铺子的那个装了铁丝网的玻璃橱窗上使劲打了一下。他赶来正好看见一只手从铁丝网和玻璃上被拳头打破的一个洞里伸进来，把一块面包抓走了。易查博赶忙追出来，那小偷也拚命逃，易查博跟在他后面追，捉住了他。他丢了面包，胳膊却还流着血。</P>

    那正是冉阿让。</P>

    那是一七九五年的事。冉阿让被控为“黑夜破坏有人住着的房屋入内行窃”，送到当时的法院。他原有一枝枪，他比世上任何枪手都射得好，有时并且喜欢私自打猎，那对他是很不利的。大家对私自打猎的人早有一种合法的成见。私自打猎的人正如走私的人，都和土匪相去不远。但是，我们附带说一句，那种人和城市中那些卑鄙无耻的杀人犯比较起来总还有天壤之别。私自打猎的人住在森林里，走私的人住在山中或海上。城市会使人变得凶残，因为它使人腐化堕落。山、海和森林使人变得粗野。它们只发展这种野性，却不毁灭人性。</P>

    冉阿让被判罪。法律的条文是死板的。在我们的文明里，有许多令人寒心的时刻，那就是刑法令人陷入绝境的时刻。一个有思想的生物被迫远离社会，遭到了无可挽救的遗弃，那是何等悲惨的日子！冉阿让被宣判服五年苦役。</P>

    一七九六年四月二十二日，巴黎正欢呼意大利前线①总指挥（共和四年花月二日执政内阁致五百人院咨文中称作Buona－Parte②的那位总指挥）在芒泰诺泰③所获的胜利。这同一天，在比塞特监狱中却扣上了一长条铁链。冉阿让便是那铁链上的一个。当时的一个禁子，现在已年近九十了，还记得非常清楚，那天，那个可怜人待在院子的北角上，被锁在第四条链子的末尾。他和其余的犯人一样，坐在地上。他除了知道他的地位可怕以外好象完全莫名其妙。或许在他那种全无知识的穷人的混沌观念里，他多少也还觉得在这件事里有些过火的地方。当别人在他脑后用大锤钉着他枷上的大头钉时，他不禁痛哭起来。眼泪使他气塞，呜咽不能成声。他只能断续地说：“我是法维洛勒修树枝的工人。”过后，他一面痛哭，一面伸起他的右手，缓缓地按下去，这样一共做了七次，好象他依次抚摩了七个高矮不齐的头顶。我们从他这动作上可以猜想到，他所做的任何事全是为了那七个孩子的衣食。 </P>

    ①当时欧洲联盟国的军队从意大利和莱茵河两方面进攻革命的法国，拿破仑从意大利出击，在意大利境内击溃奥地利军队以后，直趋维也纳，以一年时间，迫使奥地利求和。</P>

    ②拿破仑出生于科西嘉岛，该岛原属意大利，一七六八年卖给法国。他的姓，Bonaparte（波拿巴），按原来意大利文写法是Buonaparte。此处所言咨文，将一字写成两字，盖当时其名未显，以致发生这一错误。</P>

    ③芒泰诺泰（Montenotte），意大利北部距法国国境不远的一个村镇。</P>

    他出发到土伦去。他乘着小车，颈上悬着铁链，经过二十七天的路程到了那地方。在土伦，他穿上红色囚衣。他生命中的一切全消灭了，连他的名字也消灭了。他已不再是冉阿让，而是二四六○一号。姐姐怎样了呢？七个孩子怎样了呢？谁照顾他们呢？一棵年轻的树被大齐根锯了，它的一撮嫩叶怎样了呢？</P>

    那是千篇一律的经过，那些可怜的活生生的人，上帝的创造物，从此无所凭借，无人指导，无处栖身，只得随着机缘东飘西荡，谁还能知道呵？或者是人各一方，渐渐陷入苦命人的那种丧身亡命的凄凉的迷雾里，一经进入人类的悲惨行列，他们便和那些不幸的黔首一样，一个接一个地消失了。他们背井离乡。他们乡村里的钟塔忘了他们，他们田地边的界石也忘了他们，冉阿让在监牢里住了几年之后，自己也忘了那些东西。在他的心上，从前有过一条伤口，后来只剩下一条伤痕，如是而已。关于他姐姐的消息，他在土伦从始至终只听见人家稍稍谈到过一次。那仿佛是在他坐监的第四年末。我已经想不起他是从什么地方得到了那消息。有个和他们相识的同乡人看见过他姐姐，说她到了巴黎。她住在常德尔街，即圣稣尔比斯教堂附近的一条穷街。她只带着一个孩子，她最小的那个男孩。其余的六个到什么地方去了呢？也许连她自己也不知道。每天早晨，她到木鞋街三号，一个印刷厂里去，她在那里做装订的女工。早晨六点她就得到厂，在冬季，那时离天亮还很早。在那印刷厂里有个小学校，她每天领着那七岁的孩子到学校里去读书。只不过她六点到厂，学校要到七点才开门，那孩子只好在院里等上一个钟头，等学校开门。到了冬天，那一个钟点是在黑暗中露天里等过的。他们不肯让那孩子进印刷厂的门，因为有人说他碍事。那些工人清早路过那里时，总看见那小把戏沉沉欲睡坐在石子路上，并且常是在一个黑暗的角落里，他蹲在地上，伏在他的篮子上便睡着了。下雨时，那个看门的老婆子看了过意不去，便把他引到她那破屋子里去，那屋子里只有一张破床、一架纺车和两张木椅，小孩便睡在屋角里，紧紧抱着一只猫，可以少受一点冻。到七点，学校开门了，他便跑进去。以上便是冉阿让听到的话。人家那天把这消息告诉他，那只是极短暂的一刹那，好象一扇窗子忽然开了，让他看了一眼他心爱的那些亲人的命运后随即一切又都隔绝了。从此以后，他再也没有听见人家说到过他们，永远没有得到过关于他们的其他消息，永远没有和他们再见面，也永远没有遇见过他们，并且就是在这一段悲惨故事的后半段，我们也不会再见到他们了。</P>

    到了第四年末，冉阿让有了越狱的机会。他的同伙帮助他逃走，这类事是同处困境中人常会发生的。他逃走了，在田野里自由地游荡了两天，如果自由这两个字的意义是这样的一些内容：受包围，时时朝后看，听见一点声音便吃惊，害怕一切，害怕冒烟的屋顶、过路的行人、狗叫、马跑、钟鸣、看得见东西的白昼、看不见东西的黑夜、大路、小路、树丛、睡眠。在第二天晚上，他又被逮住了。三十六个钟头以来他没有吃也没有睡。海港法庭对他这次过失，判决延长拘禁期三年，一共是八年。到第六年他又有了越狱的机会，他要利用那机会，但是他没能逃脱。点名时他不在。警炮响了，到了晚上，巡夜的人在一只正在建造的船骨里找到了他，他拒捕，但是被捕了。越狱并且拒捕，那种被特别法典预见的事受了加禁五年的处罚。五年当中，要受两年的夹链。一共是十三年。到第十年，他又有了越狱的机会，他又要趁机试一试，仍没有成功。那次的新企图又被判监禁三年。一共是十六年。到末了，我想是在第十三年内，他试了最后的一次，所得的成绩只是在四个钟头之后又被拘捕。那四个钟头换来了三年的监禁。一共是十九年。到一八一五年的十月里他被释放了。他是在一七九六年关进去的，为了打破一块玻璃，拿了一个面包。</P>

    此地不妨说一句题外的话。本书作者在他对刑法问题和法律裁判的研究里遇见的那种为了窃取一个面包而造成终身悲局的案情，这是第二次。克洛德·格①偷了一个面包，冉阿让也偷了一个面包。英国的一个统计家说，在伦敦五件窃案里，四件是由饥饿直接引起的。 </P>

    ①克洛德·格（ClaudeGueux）。雨果一八三四年为穷苦人民呼吁的小说《克洛德·格》的主角。</P>

    冉阿让走进牢狱时一面痛哭，面战栗，出狱时却无动于衷；他进去时悲痛失望，出来时老气横秋。</P>

    这个人的心有过怎样的波动呢？</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 7 The Interior of Despair

    Let us try to say it. </P>

    It is necessary that society should look at these things, because it is itself which creates them. </P>

    He was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool. The light of nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also possesses a clearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, in the cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon the plank bed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated. </P>

    He constituted himself the tribunal. </P>

    He began by putting himself on trial. </P>

    He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished. He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act; that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it; that, in any case, it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work; that it is not an unanswerable argument to say, "Can one wait when one is hungry?" That, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to die of hunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally and physically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to have patience; that that would even have been better for those poor little children; that it had been an act of madness for him, a miserable, unfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar, and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong. </P>

    Then he asked himself-- </P>

    Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whether it was not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he, an industrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault once committed and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious and disproportioned. Whether there had not been more abuse on the part of the law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault. Whether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale, in the one which contains expiation. Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crime, and did not result in reversing the situation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression, of converting the guilty man into the victim, and the debtor into the creditor, and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it. </P>

    Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of society against the individual, a crime which was being committed afresh every day, a crime which had lasted nineteen years. </P>

    He asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess, a default of work and an excess of punishment. </P>

    Whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration. </P>

    These questions put and answered, he judged society and condemned it. </P>

    He condemned it to his hatred. </P>

    He made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account. He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not, in truth, unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous. </P>

    Anger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully; one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one's side at bottom. Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated. </P>

    And besides, human society had done him nothing but harm; he had never seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, and which it shows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched him to bruise him. Every contact with them had been a blow. Never, since his infancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance. From suffering to suffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a war; and that in this war he was the conquered. He had no other weapon than his hate. He resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away with him when he departed. </P>

    There was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantin friars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them. He was of the number who had a mind. He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read, to write, to cipher. He felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortify his hate. In certain cases, education and enlightenment can serve to eke out evil. </P>

    This is a sad thing to say; after having judged society, which had caused his unhappiness, he judged Providence, which had made society, and he condemned it also. </P>

    Thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery, this soul mounted and at the same time fell. Light entered it on one side, and darkness on the other. </P>

    Jean Valjean had not, as we have seen, an evil nature. He was still good when he arrived at the galleys. He there condemned society, and felt that he was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, and was conscious that he was becoming impious. </P>

    It is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point. </P>

    Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom? Can the man created good by God be rendered wicked by man? Can the soul be completely made over by fate, and become evil, fate being evil? Can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault? Is there not in every human soul, was there not in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, a first spark, a divine element, incorruptible in this world, immortal in the other, which good can develop, fan, ignite, and make to glow with splendor, and which evil can never wholly extinguish? </P>

    Grave and obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologist would probably have responded no, and that without hesitation, had he beheld at Toulon, during the hours of repose, which were for Jean Valjean hours of revery, this gloomy galley-slave, seated with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan, with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent its dragging, serious, silent, and thoughtful, a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath, condemned by civilization, and regarding heaven with severity. </P>

    Certainly,--and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,-- the observing physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery; he would, perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law's making; but he would not have even essayed any treatment; he would have turned aside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within this soul, and, like Dante at the portals of hell, he would have effaced from this existence the word which the finger of God has, nevertheless, inscribed upon the brow of every man,--hope. </P>

    Was this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, as perfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after their formation, and had he seen distinctly during the process of their formation, all the elements of which his moral misery was composed? Had this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had, by degrees, mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had, for so many years, formed the inner horizon of his spirit? Was he conscious of all that passed within him, and of all that was working there? That is something which we do not presume to state; it is something which we do not even believe. There was too much ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after his misfortune, to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there. At times he did not rightly know himself what he felt. Jean Valjean was in the shadows; he suffered in the shadows; he hated in the shadows; one might have said that he hated in advance of himself. He dwelt habitually in this shadow, feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer. Only, at intervals, there suddenly came to him, from without and from within, an access of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a livid and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul, and caused to appear abruptly all around him, in front, behind, amid the gleams of a frightful light, the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny. </P>

    The flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He no longer knew. The peculiarity of pains of this nature, in which that which is pitiless--that is to say, that which is brutalizing--predominates, is to transform a man, little by little, by a sort of stupid transfiguration, into a wild beast; sometimes into a ferocious beast. </P>

    Jean Valjean's successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul. Jean Valjean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless and foolish as they were, as often as the opportunity had presented itself, without reflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experiences which he had already gone through. He escaped impetuously, like the wolf who finds his cage open. Instinct said to him, "Flee!" Reason would have said, "Remain!" But in the presence of so violent a temptation, reason vanished; nothing remained but instinct. The beast alone acted. When he was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild. </P>

    One detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan, Jean Valjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced that implement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly called orgueil [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the name of the Rue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were repairing the balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those admirable caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the point of falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the caryatid with his shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive. </P>

    His suppleness even exceeded his strength. Certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined. It is the science of muscles. An entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners, men who are forever envious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical surface, and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible, was play to Jean Valjean. An angle of the wall being given, with the tension of his back and legs, with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone, he raised himself as if by magic to the third story. He sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison. </P>

    He spoke but little. He laughed not at all. An excessive emotion was required to wring from him, once or twice a year, that lugubrious laugh of the convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. To all appearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible. </P>

    He was absorbed, in fact. </P>

    Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him. In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled, each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance, he perceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightful accumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond the range of his vision,-- laws, prejudices, men, and deeds,--whose outlines escaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished, here and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, now afar off and on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail, vividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there the gendarme and his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top, like a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to him that these distant splendors, far from dissipating his night, rendered it more funereal and more black. All this-- laws, prejudices, deeds, men, things--went and came above him, over his head, in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which God imparts to civilization, walking over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference. Souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the reproved of the law, feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable for him who is without, so frightful for him who is beneath, resting upon their heads. </P>

    In this situation Jean Valjean meditated; and what could be the nature of his meditation? </P>

    If the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, it would, doubtless, think that same thing which Jean Valjean thought. </P>

    All these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full of realities, had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable. </P>

    At times, amid his convict toil, he paused. He fell to thinking. His reason, at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore, rose in revolt. Everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd; everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible. He said to himself, "It is a dream." He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing a few paces from him; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel. </P>

    Visible nature hardly existed for him. It would almost be true to say that there existed for Jean Valjean neither sun, nor fine summer days, nor radiant sky, nor fresh April dawns. I know not what vent-hole daylight habitually illumined his soul. </P>

    To sum up, in conclusion, that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out, we will confine ourselves to the statement that, in the course of nineteen years, Jean Valjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles, the formidable convict of Toulon, had become capable, thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him, of two sorts of evil action: firstly, of evil action which was rapid, unpremeditated, dashing, entirely instinctive, in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone; secondly, of evil action which was serious, grave, consciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish. His deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases, which natures of a certain stamp can alone traverse,--reasoning, will, perseverance. He had for moving causes his habitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a profound sense of indignities suffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent, and the just, if there are any such. The point of departure, like the point of arrival, for all his thoughts, was hatred of human law; that hatred which, if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident, becomes, within a given time, the hatred of society, then the hatred of the human race, then the hatred of creation, and which manifests itself by a vague, incessant, and brutal desire to do harm to some living being, no matter whom. It will be perceived that it was not without reason that Jean Valjean's passport described him as a very dangerous man. </P>

    From year to year this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatal sureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear.</P>

    让我们试述一下。</P>

    社会必须正视这些事，因为这些事是它自己制造出来的。</P>

    我们已经说过，冉阿让只是个无知识的人，并不是个愚蠢的人，他心里生来就燃着性灵的光。愁苦（愁苦也有它的光）更增加了他心里的那一点微光。他终日受着棍棒、鞭笞、镣铐、禁闭、疲乏之苦，受着狱中烈日的折磨，睡在囚犯的木板库上他扪心自问，反躬自省。</P>

    他自己组织法庭。</P>

    他开始审问自己。</P>

    他承认自己不是一个无罪的人，受的处分也没有过分。他承认自己犯了一种应受指摘的鲁莽的行为；假使当初他肯向人乞讨那块面包，人家也许不会不给；无论给与不给，他总应当从别人的哀怜或自己的工作中去等待那块面包；有些人说肚子饿了也能等待么？这并不是一种无可非难的理由；真正饿死的事根本就很少见到；并且无论是幸或不幸，人类生来在肉体上和精神上总是能长期受苦、多方受苦而不至于送命的；所以应当忍耐；即使是为那些可怜的孩子们着想，那样做也比较妥当些；象他那样一个不幸的贱人也敢挺身和整个社会搏斗，还自以为依靠偷窃，就可以解除困难，那完全是一种疯狂举动；无论怎样，如果你通过一道门能脱离穷困，但同时又落入不名誉的境地，那样的门总还是一扇坏门；总之，他错了。</P>

    随后他又问自己：</P>

    在他这次走上绝路的过程中，他是否是唯一有过失的人？愿意工作，但缺少工作，愿意劳动，而又缺少面包，首先这能不能不算是件严重的事呢？后来，犯了过失，并且招认了，处罚又是否苛刻过分了呢？法律在处罚方面所犯的错误，是否比犯人在犯罪方面所犯的错误更严重呢？天平的两端，在处罚那端的砝码是否太重了一些呢？加重处罚绝不能消除过失；加重处罚的结果并不能扭转情势，并不能以惩罚者的过失代替犯罪者的过失，也并不能使犯罪的人转为受损害的人，使债务人转为债权人，使侵犯人权的人受到人权的保障，这种看法是否正确呢？企图越狱一次，便加重处罚一次，这种作法的结果，是否构成强者对弱者的谋害，是否构成社会侵犯个人的罪行，并使这种罪行日日都在重犯，一直延续到十九年之久呢？</P>

    他再问自己：人类社会是否有权使它的成员在某种情况下接受它那种无理的不关心态度，而在另一种情况下又同样接受它那种无情的不放心态度，并使一个穷苦的人永远陷入一种不是缺乏（工作的缺乏）就是过量（刑罚的过量）的苦海中呢？贫富的形成往往由于机会，在社会的成员中，分得财富最少的人也正是最需要照顾的人，而社会对他们恰又苛求最甚，这样是否合乎情理呢？</P>

    他提出这些问题，并作出结论以后，他便开始审判社会，并且判了它的罪。</P>

    他凭心中的愤怒判了它的罪。</P>

    他认为社会对他的遭遇是应当负责的，他下定决心，将来总有一天，他要和它算账。他宣称他自己对别人造成的损失和别人对他造成的损失，两相比较，太不平衡，他最后的结论是他所受的处罚实际上并不是不公允，而肯定是不平等的。</P>

    盛怒可能是疯狂和妄诞的，发怒有时也会发错的，但是，人，如果不是在某一方面确有理由，是不会愤慨的。冉阿让觉得自己在愤慨了。</P>

    再说，人类社会所加于他的只是残害。他所看到的社会，历来只是它摆在它的打击对象面前自称为正义的那副怒容。世人和他接触，无非是为了要达到迫害他的目的。他和他们接触，每次都受到打击。从他的幼年，从失去母亲、失去姐姐以来，他从来没有听到过一句友好的言语，也从没有见过一次和善的嘴脸。由痛苦到痛苦，他逐渐得出了一种结论：人生即战争，并且在这场战争里，他是一名败兵。他除了仇恨以外没有其他武器。于是他下定决心，要在监牢里磨练他这武器，并带着它出狱。</P>

    有些无知的教士在土伦办了一所囚犯学校，把一些必要的课程教给那些不幸人中的有毅力者。他就是那些有毅力者中的一个。他四十岁进学校，学习了读，写，算。他感到提高他的知识，也就是加强他的仇恨。在某种情况下，教育和智力都是可以起济恶的作用的。</P>

    有件事说来很可惜，他在审判了造成他的不幸的社会以后，他接着又审判创造社会的上帝。</P>

    他也定了上帝的罪。</P>

    在那十九年的苦刑和奴役中，这个人的心是一面上升，一面也堕落了。他一面醒悟，一面糊涂。</P>

    我们已经知道，冉阿让并不是一个生性恶劣的人。初进监牢时他还是个好人。他在监牢里判了社会的罪后觉得自己的心狠起来了，在判了上帝的罪后他觉得自己成了天不怕地不怕的人了。</P>

    我们在这里不能不仔细想想。</P>

    人的性情真能那样彻头彻尾完全改变吗？人由上帝创造，生而性善，能通过人力使他性恶吗？灵魂能不能由于恶劣命运的影响彻底转成恶劣的呢？人心难道也能象矮屋下的背脊一样，因痛苦压迫过甚而蜷屈萎缩变为畸形丑态，造成各种不可救药的残废吗？在每个人的心里，特别是在冉阿让的心里，难道没有一点原始的火星，一种来自上帝的素质，在人间不朽，在天上不灭，可以因善而发扬、鼓舞、光大、昌炽，发为奇观异彩，并且永远也不会完全被恶扑灭吗？</P>

    这是一些严重而深奥的问题，任何一个生理学家，他如果在土伦看见过这个苦役犯叉着两条胳膊，坐在绞盘的铁杆上休息（休息也就是冉阿让思前想后的时刻），链头纳在衣袋里，以免拖曳，神情颓丧、严肃、沉默、若有所思；他如果看见过这个被法律抛弃的贱人经常以愤怒的眼光注视着所有的人，他如果看见过这个被文明排斥了的罪犯经常以严厉的颜色仰望天空，他也许会不假思索地对上面那些问题中最后的一个，回答说：“没有。”</P>

    当然，我们也并不想隐瞒，这位作为观察者的生理学家也许会在这种场合，看出一种无可挽救的惨局，他也许会替那个被法律伤害了的人叫屈，可是他却连医治的方法也没有想过，他也许会掉转头，不望那个人心上的伤口，他并且会象那个掉头不望地狱门的但丁，把上帝写在每个人前额上的“希望”二字从这个人的生命中拭去。</P>

    他的思想情况，我们已试着分析过了，冉阿让本人对自己的思想情况，是否和我们替本书读者试作的分析一样明白呢？构成冉阿让精神痛苦的那一切因素，在形成以后，冉阿让是否看得清楚呢？在它们一一形成的过程中，他又是否看清楚过呢？他的思想是层层发展的，他日甚一日地被困在许多愁惨的景象中颠来倒去，多年以来，他的精神，就始终被局限在那些景象的范围以内，粗鲁不文的他对这种思想的发展层次是否完全了解呢？他对自己思想的起伏波动是否十分明确呢？那是我们不敢肯定的，也是我们不敢相信的。冉阿让太没有知识了，他虽然受了那么多的痛苦，但对这些事，却仍是迷迷糊糊的，有时，他甚至还不知道他所感受的究竟是什么。冉阿让落在黑暗里，他便在黑暗里吃苦，他便在黑暗里愤恨，我们可以说，他无往而不恨。他经常生活在暗无天日的环境中，如同一个盲人或梦游者一样瞎摸瞎撞。不过，在某些时候，他也会，由于内因或外因，忽然感到一股怨气的突袭，一阵异乎寻常的苦痛，他会感到突然出现一道惨淡的、一闪即逝的光，照彻他的整个心灵，同时也使他命运中的种种险恶的深渊和悲惨的远景，在那片凶光的照射下一齐出现在他的前后左右。</P>

    闪光过后仍旧是黑夜沉沉，他在什么地方？他又莫名其妙了。</P>

    那种刑罚的最不人道，也就是说，最足以戕贼人的智慧的地方，就是它特别能使人经过一种慢性的毒害逐渐化为野兽，有时还化为猛兽。冉阿让屡次执拗不变地图谋越狱，已足够证明法律在人心上所起的那种特殊作用。冉阿让的那种计划完全是无济于事的，愚蠢的，但是只要能得到机会，他总要试一试，绝不想到它的后果，也不想到既得的经验。他象一头狼，看见笼门开了，总要慌忙出逃。本能向他说：“快逃！”理智却会向他说：“待下！”但是面对着那样强烈的引诱，他的理智终于消失了，他有的只是本能。在那里活动着的只是兽性。他在重新被捕以后受到的新处罚，又足以使他更加惊惶失措。</P>

    有一件我们不应当忽略的小事，就是他体质强壮，苦役牢里的那些人都比不上他。服劳役时，扭铁索，推绞盘，冉阿让抵得上四个人。他的手举得起、背也能够扛得动非常重大的东西。有时他可以代替一个千斤顶，千斤顶在从前叫做“骄子”，巴黎菜市场附近的那条骄子山街，我们附带说一句，便是以此得名的。他的伙伴们替他起了个浑名，叫冉千斤。一次，土伦市政厅正修理阳台，阳台下面有许多彼惹雕的人形柱，美丽可喜，其中一根脱了榫，几乎倒下来。当时冉阿让正在那里，他居然用肩头撑住了那根柱子等着其余的工人来修理。</P>

    他身体的轻捷比他的力气更可观。有些囚徒终年梦想潜逃，于是他们把巧和力结合起来，形成一种真正的科学。那些无时不羡慕飞虫飞鸟的囚徒，每日都练习一种神奇的巧技。冉阿让的特长便是能直登陡壁，在不易发现的凸处找出着力的地方。他在墙角里把肘弯和脚跟靠紧石块上的不平处，便能利用背部和腿弯的伸张力，妖魔似的升到四楼。有时，他还用那种方法直上监狱的房顶。</P>

    他很少说话。他从不笑。必得有一种外来的刺激才能使他发出一种象是魔鬼笑声的回音的苦笑，那也是一年难得一两次的事。看他那神气，仿佛随时在留心瞧着一种骇人的东西。</P>

    他的确是一心一意在想什么事的样子。</P>

    他的禀赋既不完全，智力又受了摧残，通过他那种不健全的辨别能力，他隐约感到有一种怪物附在他身上。他在那种阴暗、惨白、半明不暗的地方过着非人的生活，他每次转过头颈，想往上看时，便又恐怖又愤怒地看见在自己头上，层层叠叠地有一堆大得可怕的东西，法律、偏见、人和事，堆积如山，直到望不见的高度，崇危峻险，令人心悸，它的形状不是他所能知道的，它的体积使他心胆俱裂，这并不是旁的东西，只是那座不可思议的金字塔，我们所谓的文明。这儿那儿，在那堆蠕蠕欲动、形状畸异、忽远忽近的东西上面和一些高不可攀的高原上面，他看见一群群的人，被强烈的光线照得须眉毕现，这儿是携带棍棒的狱卒，手持钢刀的警察，那边是戴着高冠的总主教，最高处，一片圆光的中央，却是戴着冠冕、耀人眼睛的帝王。远处的那些奇观异彩似乎不但不能惊醒他的沉梦，反而使他更加悲伤，更加惶惑。举凡法律、偏见、物体、人和事，都按上帝在文明方面所指定的神秘复杂的动态，在他的头上来来去去，用一种凶残却又平和、安详却又苛刻、无可言状的态度在践踏他，蹂躏他。所有沉在恶运底下、陷在无人怜恤的十八层地狱里面、被法律所摈弃的人们，觉得这个社会的全部重量都压在他们的头上，这种社会对处在它外面的人是多么可怕，对处在它下面的人是多么可怕。</P>

    冉阿让在这种情况下，东想西想，但是他的思想是怎样一种性质的呢？</P>

    假使磨盘底下的黍粒有思维的能力，它所想的也许就是冉阿让所想的了。</P>

    结果，那种充满了鬼影的现实和充满了现实的鬼域替他构成了一种几乎无可言喻的内心状况。</P>

    有时，他正在干着牢里的工作，会忽然停着不动，细想起来。他的那种比以前更加成熟、但也更加混乱的理性起来反抗了。他觉得他所遭受的一切都是不合理的。环绕他的一切都是不近人情的。他常对自己说这是一场梦，他望着那个站在他几步以外的狱卒，会觉得那是一个鬼，那个鬼突然给他吃了一棍。</P>

    对他来说，这个历历可见的自然界是若有若无的。我们几乎可以说，对冉阿让，无所谓太阳，无所谓春秋佳日，无所谓晴空，无所谓四月天的清凉晓色。我不知道是怎样一种黯淡的光经常照着他的心。</P>

    最后，如果我们要把我们以上所谈的一切，择其可以总括的总括起来，指出一个明确的结果的话，我们只能说，冉阿让，法维洛勒的一个安分守己的修树枝工人，土伦的一个强顽的囚犯，由于监狱潜移默化的作用，十九年来已有能力做出两种坏行为：第一种坏行为是急切的、不假思索的、轻躁的、完全出自本能的，是对他所受痛苦的反击；第二种坏行为是阴沉的、持重的、平心静气考虑过的、用他从痛苦中得来的那种错误观念深思熟虑过的。他的打算经常通过三个连续的层次：思考，决心，固执；只有某种性格的人才会走上这条路。起因是由于一贯愤慨，心灵的苦闷，由于受虐待而引起的深刻的恶感、对人的反抗，包括对善良、无辜、公正的人的反抗，假如世上真有这几种人的话。他一切思想的出发点和目的全是对人类法律的仇恨；那种仇恨，在它发展的过程中，如果得不到某种神智来加以制止，就可以在一定的时刻变成对社会的仇恨，再变成对人类的仇恨，再变成对造物的仇恨，最后变成一种无目标、无止境、凶狠残暴的为害欲，不问是谁，逢人便害。我们知道，那张护照称冉阿让“为人异常险狠”，不是没有理由的。</P>

    年复一年，这个人的心慢慢地、但是无可挽救地越变越硬了。他的心一硬，他的眼泪也就干了。直到他出狱的那天，十九年中，他没有流过一滴泪。</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 8 Billows and Shadows

    A man overboard!</P>

    What matters it? The vessel does not halt. The wind blows. That sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue. It passes on.</P>

    The man disappears, then reappears; he plunges, he rises again to the surface; he calls, he stretches out his arms; he is not heard. The vessel, trembling under the hurricane, is wholly absorbed in its own workings; the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man; his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves. He gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths. What a spectre is that retreating sail! He gazes and gazes at it frantically. It retreats, it grows dim, it diminishes in size. He was there but just now, he was one of the crew, he went and came along the deck with the rest, he had his part of breath and of sunlight, he was a living man. Now, what has taken place? He has slipped, he has fallen; all is at an end.</P>

    He is in the tremendous sea. Under foot he has nothing but what flees and crumbles. The billows, torn and lashed by the wind, encompass him hideously; the tossings of the abyss bear him away; all the tongues of water dash over his head; a populace of waves spits upon him; confused openings half devour him; every time that he sinks, he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night; frightful and unknown vegetations seize him, knot about his feet, draw him to them; he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss, that he forms part of the foam; the waves toss him from one to another; he drinks in the bitterness; the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously, to drown him; the enormity plays with his agony. It seems as though all that water were hate.</P>

    Nevertheless, he struggles.</P>

    He tries to defend himself; he tries to sustain himself; he makes an effort; he swims. He, his petty strength all exhausted instantly, combats the inexhaustible.</P>

    Where, then, is the ship? Yonder. Barely visible in the pale shadows of the horizon.</P>

    The wind blows in gusts; all the foam overwhelms him. He raises his eyes and beholds only the lividness of the clouds. He witnesses, amid his death-pangs, the immense madness of the sea. He is tortured by this madness; he hears noises strange to man, which seem to come from beyond the limits of the earth, and from one knows not what frightful region beyond.</P>

    There are birds in the clouds, just as there are angels above human distresses; but what can they do for him? They sing and fly and float, and he, he rattles in the death agony.</P>

    He feels himself buried in those two infinities, the ocean and the sky, at one and the same time: the one is a tomb; the other is a shroud.</P>

    Night descends; he has been swimming for hours; his strength is exhausted; that ship, that distant thing in which there were men, has vanished; he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf; he sinks, he stiffens himself, he twists himself; he feels under him the monstrous billows of the invisible; he shouts.</P>

    There are no more men. Where is God?</P>

    He shouts. Help! Help! He still shouts on.</P>

    Nothing on the horizon; nothing in heaven.</P>

    He implores the expanse, the waves, the seaweed, the reef; they are deaf. He beseeches the tempest; the imperturbable tempest obeys only the infinite.</P>

    Around him darkness, fog, solitude, the stormy and nonsentient tumult, the undefined curling of those wild waters. In him horror and fatigue. Beneath him the depths. Not a point of support. He thinks of the gloomy adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow. The bottomless cold paralyzes him. His hands contract convulsively; they close, and grasp nothingness. Winds, clouds, whirlwinds, gusts, useless stars! What is to be done? The desperate man gives up; he is weary, he chooses the alternative of death; he resists not; he lets himself go; he abandons his grip; and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulfment.</P>

    Oh, implacable march of human societies! Oh, losses of men and of souls on the way! Ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip! Disastrous absence of help! Oh, moral death!</P>

    The sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling their condemned. The sea is the immensity of wretchedness.</P>

    The soul, going down stream in this gulf, may become a corpse. Who shall resuscitate it?</P>

    一个人落在海里了！</P>

    有什么要紧！船是不会停的。风刮着，这条阴暗的船有它非走不可的路程。它过去了。</P>

    那个人灭了顶，随后又出现，忽沉忽浮，漂在水面，他叫喊，扬手，却没有人听见他的喊声。船呢，在飓风里飘荡不定，人们正忙于操作，海员和旅客，对那个落水的人，甚至连一眼也不再望了，他那个可怜的头只是沧海中的一粟而已。</P>

    他在深处发出了悲惨的呼号。那条驶去的帆船简直是个鬼影！他望着它，发狂似的望着它。它越去越远，船影渐淡，船身也渐小了。刚才他还在那船上，是船员中的一员，和其余的人一道在甲板上忽来忽往，他有他的一份空气和阳光，还是一个活生生的人。现在，出了什么事呢？他滑了一交，掉了下去，这就完了。</P>

    他被困在惊涛骇浪中。他的脚只能踏着虚空，只能往下沉。迎风崩裂的波涛狠狠地包围着他，波峰波谷带着他辗转上下，一缕缕的白练飞腾在他的头上，一阵阵的狂澜向他喷唾，巨浪的口把他吞没殆半；他每次下沉，都隐约看见那黑暗的深渊，一些未曾见过的奇怪植物捉住他，缠着他的脚，把他拉向它们那里去；他觉得自己也成了旋涡，也成了泡沫的一部分，波涛把他往复抛掷；他喝着苦汁，无情的海水前仆后继，定要把他淹没，浩瀚的泽国拿他的垂死挣扎来取乐。好象这里的水对他全怀着仇恨。</P>

    但是他仍旧挣扎，尽力保卫自己，他振奋精神，努力泅泳。</P>

    他微弱的力气立刻告竭了，仍旧和无边无际的波涛奋斗。</P>

    船到哪里去了？在前面。在水天相接、惨淡无光的地方，仿佛还隐约可辨。</P>

    狂风在吼，无穷的浪花在向他猛扑。他抬起眼睛，只见行云的灰暗色。他气息奄奄地目击浩海的疯狂，而这种疯狂已把他置于绝地了。他听见一片从未听过的怪声，仿佛是从世外，从不知何处恐怖的国度里飞来。</P>

    在云里有许多飞鸟，如同在人生祸患的上面有许多天使。但是它们和他有什么相干呢？它们飞、鸣、翱翔；至于他，他呼号待毙。</P>

    他觉得自己同时被两种广大无边的东西所掩埋：海和天，一种是墓穴，一种是殓衣。</P>

    黑夜来了，他已经泅泳了几个钟头，力气使尽了，那条船，那条载着一些人的远远的船，已经不见了。他孤零零陷在那可怕的，笼罩在暮色中的深渊里，他往下沉，他挣扎，他扭动身体，在他的底下他觉得有些目不能见的渺茫的怪物。他号着。</P>

    人全不在了。上帝在什么地方呢？</P>

    他喊着，救命呀！救命呀！他不停地喊着。</P>

    水边没有一点东西，天上也没有一点东西。</P>

    他向空际、波涛、海藻、礁石哀求；它们都充耳不闻。他向暴风央求；坚强的暴风只服从太空的号令。</P>

    在他四周的是夜色、暮霭、寂寥、奔腾放逐的骚乱、起伏不停的怒涛。他的身体中只有恐怖和疲惫。他的脚下只有一片虚空。没有立足的地方。他想到他的尸体漂浮在那无限凄凉的幽冥里。无底的寒泉使他僵直。他的手痉挛，握着的是虚空。风，云，漩流，狂飙，无用的群星！怎么办呵？那失望的人只得听从命运摆布了，穷于应付的人往往坐以待毙，他只得听其自然，任其飘荡不再抵抗了，看呵，他从此跌入灭亡的阴惨深渊里了。</P>

    呵，人类社会历久不变的行程！途中多少人和灵魂要丧失！人类社会是所有那些被法律抛弃了的人的海洋！那里最惨的是没有援助！呵，这是精神的死亡！</P>

    海，就是冷酷无情的法律抛掷它牺牲品的总渊薮。海，就是无边的苦难。</P>

    漂在那深渊里的心灵可以变成尸体，将来谁使它复活呢？</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 9 New Troubles

    When the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, when Jean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, Thou art free! the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a ray of the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. But it was not long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided.</P>

    And this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated that his earnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to a hundred and seventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays and festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs. At all events, his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which had been counted out to him on his departure. He had understood nothing of this, and had thought himself wronged. Let us say the word--robbed.</P>

    On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of an orange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. He offered his services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set to work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master seemed pleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed, observed him, and demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the yellow passport. That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation; he had been told thirty sous. When evening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on the following day, he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid. The owner did not utter a word, but handed him fifteen sous. He objected. He was told, "That is enough for thee." He persisted. The master looked him straight between the eyes, and said to him "Beware of the prison."</P>

    There, again, he considered that he had been robbed.</P>

    Society, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him wholesale. Now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail.</P>

    Liberation is not deliverance. One gets free from the galleys, but not from the sentence.</P>

    That is what happened to him at Grasse. We have seen in what manner he was received at D----</P>

    当冉阿让出狱时，他听见有人在他耳边说了这样一句奇特的话“你自由了”，那一片刻竟好象是不真实的，闻所未闻的；一道从不曾有过的强烈的光，一道人生的真实的光突然射到他的心里。但是这道光，一会儿就黯淡下去了。冉阿让起初想到自由，不禁欣然自喜，他以为得着新生命了。但他很快又想到，既然拿的是一张黄护照，所谓自由也就是那么一回事。</P>

    而且在这件事上也还有不少的苦情。他计算过，他的储蓄，按照他在狱中度过的岁月计算，本应有一百七十一个法郎。还应当指出，十九年中，礼拜日和节日的强迫休息大致要使他少赚二十四个法郎，他还忘了把那个数目加入他的账目。不管怎样，他的储蓄经过照例的七折八扣以后，已减到一百○九个法郎十五个苏。那就是他在出狱时所领到的。</P>

    他虽然不了解这其中的道理，但他认为他总是吃了亏。让我们把话说明白，他是被人盗窃了。</P>

    出狱的第二天，他到了格拉斯，他在一家橙花香精提炼厂的门前，看见许多人在卸货。他请求加入工作。那时工作正吃紧，他们同意了。他便动起手来。他聪明、强壮、伶俐，他尽力搬运，主人好象也满意。正在他工作时，有个警察走过，注意到他，便向他要证件。他只好把那黄护照拿出来。警察看完以后，冉阿让又去工作。他先头问过一个工人，做那种工作每天可以赚多少钱。那工人回答他说：“三十个苏。”到了晚上，他走去找那香精厂的厂主，请把工资付给他，因为他第二天一早便得上路。厂主没说一句话，给了他十五个苏。他提出要求。那人回答他说：“这对你已是够好的了。”他仍旧要。那主人睁圆了两只眼睛对他说：“小心黑屋子。”</P>

    那一次，他又觉得自己被盗窃了。</P>

    社会、政府，在削减他的储蓄上大大地盗窃了他一次，现在是轮到那小子来偷窃他了。</P>

    被释放并不等于得到解放。他固然出了牢狱，但仍背着罪名。</P>

    那就是他在格拉斯遇到的事，至于后来他在迪涅受到的待遇，我们已经知道了。</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 10 The Man aroused

    As the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke.</P>

    What woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.</P>

    He had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. He was accustomed not to devote many hours to repose.</P>

    He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then he closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.</P>

    When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters preoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time. Sleep comes more easily than it returns. This is what happened to Jean Valjean. He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.</P>

    He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one's mind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming disproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and perturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all others. We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the six sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had placed on the table.</P>

    Those six sets of silver haunted him.--They were there.--A few paces distant.--Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.-- He had taken careful note of this cupboard.--On the right, as you entered from the dining-room.--They were solid.--And old silver.-- From the ladle one could get at least two hundred francs.-- Double what he had earned in nineteen years.--It is true that he would have earned more if "the administration had not robbed him."</P>

    His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was certainly mingled some struggle. Three o'clock struck. He opened his eyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed, and placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost without knowing it, seated on his bed.</P>

    He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would have been suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus in the dark, the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping. All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placed them softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful attitude, and became motionless once more.</P>

    Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew, re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also, without knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of revery, of a convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. The checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.</P>

    He remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely, even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one--the half or quarter hour. It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, "Come on!"</P>

    He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all was quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not very dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort of twilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passersby come and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed it again immediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.</P>

    Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, opened it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up again, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the visor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in the angle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there. It resembled a short bar of iron, pointed like a pike at one end. It would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club.</P>

    In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner's candlestick. Convicts were, at that period, sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ Toulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners' tools at their command. These miners' candlesticks are of massive iron, terminated at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which they are stuck into the rock.</P>

    He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.</P>

    On arriving at this door, he found it ajar. The Bishop had not closed it.</P>

    天主堂的钟正敲着早晨两点，冉阿让醒了。</P>

    那张床太舒服，因此他醒了。他没有床睡，已经快十九年了，他虽然没有脱衣，但那种感受太新奇，不能不影响他的睡眠。</P>

    他睡了四个多钟头，疲乏已经过去。他早已习惯不在休息上多花时间。</P>

    他张开眼睛，向他四周的黑暗望了一阵，随后又闭上眼，想再睡一会儿。</P>

    假使白天的感触太复杂，脑子里的事太多，我们就只能睡，而不能重行入睡，睡容易，再睡难。这正是冉阿让的情形。</P>

    他不能再睡，他便想。</P>

    他正陷入这种思想紊乱的时刻，在他的脑子里有一种看不见的、来来去去的东西。他的旧恨和新愁在他的心里翻来倒去，凌乱杂沓，漫无条理，既失去它们的形状，也无限扩大了它们的范围，随后又仿佛忽然消失在一股汹涌的浊流中。他想到许多事，但是其中有一件却反反复复一再出现，并且排除了其余的事。这一件，我们立即说出来，他注意了马格洛大娘先头放在桌上的那六副银器和那只大汤勺。</P>

    那六副银器使他烦懑。那些东西就在那里。只有几步路。刚才他经过隔壁那间屋子走到他房里来时，老大娘正把那些东西放在床头的小壁橱里。他特别注意了那壁橱。进餐室，朝右走。那些东西多重呵！并且是古银器，连那大勺至少可以卖二百法郎。是他在十九年里所赚的一倍。的确，假使“官府”没有“偷盗”他，他也许还多赚几文。</P>

    他心里反反复复，踌躇不决，斗争了整整一个钟头。三点敲过了。他重行睁开眼睛，忽然坐了起来，伸手去摸他先头丢在壁厢角里的那只布袋，随后他垂下两腿，又把脚踏在地上，几乎不知道怎样会坐在床边的。</P>

    他那样坐着，发了一阵呆，房子里的人全睡着了，惟有他独自一人醒着，假使有人看见他那样呆坐在黑暗角落里，一定会吃一惊的。他忽然弯下腰去，脱下鞋子，轻轻放在床前的席子上，又恢复他那发呆的样子，待着不动。</P>

    在那种可怕的思考中，我们刚指出的那种念头不停地在他的脑海里翻搅着，进去又出来，出来又进去，使他感受到一种压力；同时他不知道为什么，会带着梦想中那种机械的顽固性，想到他从前在监狱里认识他一个叫布莱卫的囚犯，那人的裤子只用一根棉织的背带吊住。那根背带的棋盘格花纹不停地在他脑子里显现出来。</P>

    他在那样的情形下呆着不动，并且也许会一直呆到天明，如果那只挂钟没有敲那一下棗报一刻或报半点的一下。那一下仿佛是对他说：“来吧！”</P>

    他站起来，又迟疑了一会，再侧耳细听，房子里一点声音也没有，于是他小步小步一直朝前走到隐约可辨的窗边。当时夜色并不很暗，风高月圆，白云掩映；云来月隐，云过月明，因此窗外时明时暗，室内也偶得微光。那种微光，足使室内的人行走，由于行云的作用，屋内也乍明乍暗，仿佛是人在地下室里，见风窗外面不时有人来往一样，因而室内黯淡的光也忽强忽弱。冉阿让走到窗边，把它仔细看了一遍，它没有铁闩，只有它的活梢扣着，这原是那地方的习惯。窗外便是那园子。他把窗子打开，于是一股冷空气突然钻进房来，他又立刻把它关上。他仔仔细细把那园子瞧了一遍，应当说，研究了一遍。园的四周绕着一道白围墙，相当低，容易越过。在园的尽头，围墙外面，他看见成列的树梢，彼此距离相等，说明墙外便是一条林荫道，或是一条栽有树木的小路。</P>

    瞧了那一眼之后，他做了一个表示决心的动作，向壁厢走去，拿起他的布袋，打开，从里面搜出一件东西，放在床上，又把他的鞋子塞进袋里，扣好布袋，驮在肩上，藏上他的便帽，帽檐齐眉，又伸手去摸他的棍子，把它放在窗角上，回到床边，毅然决然拿起先头放在床上的那件东西。好象是根短铁钎，一端磨到和标枪一般尖。</P>

    在黑暗里我们不易辨出那铁钎是为了作什么用才磨成那个样子的，这也许是根撬棍，也许是把铁杵。</P>

    如果是在白天，我们便认得出来，那只是一根矿工用的蜡烛钎。当时，常常派犯人到土伦周围的那些高丘上去采取岩石，他们便时常持有矿工的器械。矿工的蜡烛钎是用粗铁条做的，下面一端尖，为了好插在岩石里。</P>

    他用右手握住那根烛钎，屏住呼吸，放轻脚步，走向隔壁那间屋子，我们知道，那是主教的卧房。走到门边，他看见门是掩着的，留着一条缝。主教并没有把它关上。</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 11 What he does

    Jean Valjean listened. Not a sound.</P>

    He gave the door a push.</P>

    He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.</P>

    The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silent movement, which enlarged the opening a little.</P>

    He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.</P>

    It continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough to allow him to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, which formed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.</P>

    Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost, to enlarge the aperture still further.</P>

    He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push, more energetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.</P>

    Jean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day of Judgment.</P>

    In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that that hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed a terrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one, and warn and to wake those who were asleep. He halted, shuddering, bewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. He heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by him, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at once; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their assistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar, and the gendarmerie on hand. For a moment he thought himself lost.</P>

    He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring to make a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door had fallen wide open. He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred there. He lent an ear. Nothing was moving in the house. The noise made by the rusty hinge had not awakened any one.</P>

    This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumult within him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thought himself lost, he had not drawn back. His only thought now was to finish as soon as possible. He took a step and entered the room.</P>

    This room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague and confused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, an arm-chair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced with precaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture. He could hear, at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping Bishop.</P>

    He suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived there sooner than he had thought for.</P>

    Nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though she desired to make us reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the heavens. At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed, this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light, traversing the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop's pale face. He was sleeping peacefully. He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool, which covered his arms to the wrists. His head was thrown back on the pillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with the pastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed. His whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction, of hope, and of felicity. It was more than a smile, and almost a radiance. He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible. The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven.</P>

    A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.</P>

    It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven was within him. That heaven was his conscience.</P>

    At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak, upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. It remained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That moon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver, that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man, and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was confidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.</P>

    There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august, without being himself aware of it.</P>

    Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his iron candlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. Never had he beheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. The moral world has no grander spectacle than this: a troubled and uneasy conscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action, contemplating the slumber of the just.</P>

    That slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, had about it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiously conscious.</P>

    No one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself. In order to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even on his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with certainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, and that was all. But what was his thought? It would have been impossible to divine it. What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded. But what was the nature of this emotion?</P>

    His eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision. One would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses,-- the one in which one loses one's self and that in which one saves one's self. He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand.</P>

    At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his brow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the same deliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, his cap in his left hand, his club in his right hand, his hair bristling all over his savage head.</P>

    The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze.</P>

    The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the chimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them, with a benediction for one and pardon for the other.</P>

    Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped rapidly past the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to the cupboard, which he saw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick as though to force the lock; the key was there; he opened it; the first thing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware; he seized it, traversed the chamber with long strides, without taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the noise, gained the door, re-entered the oratory, opened the window, seized his cudgel, bestrode the window-sill of the ground-floor, put the silver into his knapsack, threw away the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like a tiger, and fled.</P>

    冉阿让张耳细听。绝没有一点声响。</P>

    他推门。</P>

    他用指尖推着，轻轻地、缓缓地、正象一只胆怯心细、想要进门的猫。</P>

    门被推以后，静悄悄地移动了几乎不能察觉的那么一点点，缝也稍微宽了一丝。</P>

    他等待了一会，再推，这次使力比较大。</P>

    门悄然逐渐开大了。现在那条缝已能容他身体过去。但是门旁有一张小桌子，那角度堵住了路，妨碍他通过门缝。</P>

    冉阿让知道那种困难。无论如何，他非得把门推得更开一些不可。</P>

    他打定主意，再推，比先头两次更使劲一些。这一次，却有个门臼，由于润滑油干了，在黑暗里突然发出一种嘶哑延续的声音。</P>

    冉阿让大吃一惊。在他耳里门臼的响声就和末日审判的号角那样洪亮骇人。</P>

    在开始行动的那一刹那间，由于幻想的扩大，他几乎认为那个门臼活起来了，并且具有一种非常的活力，就象一头狂叫的狗要向全家告警，要叫醒那些睡着的人。</P>

    他停下来，浑身哆嗦，不知所措，他原是踮着脚尖走路，现在连脚跟也落地了。他听见他的动脉在两边太阳穴里象两个铁锤那样敲打着，胸中出来的气也好象来自山洞的风声。他认为那个发怒的门臼所发出的那种震耳欲聋的声响，如果不是天崩地裂似的把全家惊醒，那是不可能的。他推的那扇门已有所警惕，并且已经叫喊；那个老人就要起来了，两个老姑娘也要大叫了，还有旁人都会前来搭救；不到一刻钟，满城都会骚乱，警察也会出动。他一下子认为自己完了。</P>

    他立在原处发慌，好象一尊石人，一动也不敢动。</P>

    几分钟过去了。门大大地开着。他冒险把那房间瞧了一遍。丝毫没有动静，他伸出耳朵听，整所房子里没有一点声音。</P>

    那个锈门臼的响声并不曾惊醒任何人。</P>

    这第一次的危险已经过了，但是他心里仍旧惊恐难受。不过他并不后退。即使是在他以为一切没有希望时，他也没有后退。他心里只想到要干就得赶快。他向前一步，便跨进了那房间。</P>

    那房间是完全寂静的。这儿那儿，他看见一些模糊紊乱的形体，如果在白天便看得出来，那只是桌上一些零乱的纸张、展开的表册、圆凳上堆着的书本、一把堆着衣服的安乐椅、一把祈祷椅，可是在这时，这些东西却一齐变为黑黝黝的空穴和迷蒙难辨的地域。冉阿让仍朝前走，谨慎小心，唯恐撞了家具。</P>

    他听到主教熟睡在那房间的尽头，发出均匀安静的呼吸。</P>

    他忽然停下来。他已到了床边。他自己并没有料到会那样快就到了主教的床边。</P>

    上天有时会在适当时刻使万物的景象和人的行动发生巧妙的配合，从而产生出深刻的效果，仿佛有意要我们多多思考似的。大致在半个钟点以前，就已有一大片乌云遮着天空。正当冉阿让停在床前，那片乌云忽然散开了，好象是故意要那样做似的，一线月光也随即穿过长窗，正正照在主教的那张苍老的脸上。主教正安安稳稳地睡着。他几乎是和衣睡在床上的，因为下阿尔卑斯一带的夜晚很冷，一件棕色的羊毛衫盖住他的胳膊，直到腕边。他的头仰在枕头上，那正是恣意休息的姿态，一只手垂在床外，指上戴着主教的指环，多少功德都是由这只手圆满了的。他的面容隐隐显出满足、乐观和安详的神情。那不仅仅是微笑，还几乎是容光的焕发。他额上反映出灵光，那是我们看不见的。心地正直的人在睡眠中也在景仰那神秘的天空。</P>

    来自天空的一线彩光正射在主教的身上。</P>

    同时他本身也是光明剔透的，因为那片天就在他的心里。</P>

    那片天就是他的信仰。</P>

    正当月光射来重叠（不妨这样说）在他心光上的时候，熟睡着的主教好象是包围在一圈灵光里。那种光却是柔和的，涵容在一种无可言喻的半明半暗的光里。天空的那片月光，地上的这种沉寂，这个了无声息的园子，这个静谧的人家，此时此刻，万籁俱寂，这一切，都使那慈祥老人酣畅的睡眠有着一种说不出的奇妙庄严的神态，并且还以一种端详肃静的圆光环绕着那些白发和那双合着的眼睛，那种充满了希望和赤忱的容颜，老人的面目和赤子的睡眠。</P>

    这个人不自觉的无比尊严几乎可以和神明媲美。冉阿让，他，却待在黑影里，手中拿着他的铁烛钎，立着不动，望着这位全身光亮的老人，有些胆寒。他从来没有见过那样的人。他那种待人的赤忱使他惊骇。一个心怀叵测、濒于犯罪的人在景仰一个睡乡中的至人，精神领域中没有比这更宏伟的场面了。</P>

    他孤零零独自一人，却酣然睡在那样一个陌生人的旁边，他那种卓绝的心怀冉阿让多少也感觉到了，不过他不为所动。</P>

    谁也说不出他的心情，连他自己也说不出。如果我们真要领会，就必须设想一种极端强暴的力和一种极端温和的力的并立。即使是从他的面色上，我们肯定不能分辨出什么来。那只是一副凶顽而又惊骇的面孔。他望着，如是而已。但是他的心境是怎样的呢？那是无从揣测的。不过，他受到了感动，受到了困扰，那是很显明的。但是那种感动究竟属于什么性质的呢？</P>

    他的眼睛没有离开老人。从他的姿势和面容上显露出来的，仅仅是一种奇特的犹豫神情。我们可以说，他正面对着两种关口而踟蹰不前，一种是自绝的关口，一种是自救的关口。</P>

    他仿佛已准备要击碎那头颅或吻那只手。</P>

    过了一会，他缓缓地举起他的左手，直到额边，脱下他的小帽，随后他的手又同样缓缓地落下去。冉阿让重又堕入冥想中了，左手拿着小帽，右手拿着铁钎，头发乱竖在他那粗野的头上。</P>

    尽管他用怎样可怕的目光望着主教，但主教仍安然酣睡。</P>

    月光依稀照着壁炉上的那个耶稣受难像，他仿佛把两只手同时伸向他们两个人，为一个降福，为另一个赦宥。忽然，冉阿让拿起他的小帽，戴在头上，不望那主教，连忙沿着床边，向他从床头可以隐隐望见的那个壁橱走去，他想起那根铁烛钎，好象要撬锁似的，但是钥匙已在那上面，他打开橱，他最先见到的东西，便是那篮银器，他提着那篮银器，大踏步穿过那间屋子，也不管声响了，走到门边，进入祈祷室，推开窗子，拿起木棍，跨过窗台，把银器放进布袋，丢下篮子，穿过园子，老虎似的跳过墙头逃了。</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 12 The Bishop works

    The next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling in his garden. Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation.</P>

    "Monseigneur, Monseigneur!" she exclaimed, "does your Grace know where the basket of silver is?"</P>

    "Yes," replied the Bishop.</P>

    "Jesus the Lord be blessed!" she resumed; "I did not know what had become of it."</P>

    The Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed. He presented it to Madame Magloire.</P>

    "Here it is."</P>

    "Well!" said she. "Nothing in it! And the silver?"</P>

    "Ah," returned the Bishop, "so it is the silver which troubles you? I don't know where it is."</P>

    "Great, good God! It is stolen! That man who was here last night has stolen it."</P>

    In a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, Madame Magloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returned to the Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as he examined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed. He rose up at Madame Magloire's cry.</P>

    "Monseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!" As she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible. The coping of the wall had been torn away.</P>

    "Stay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane. Ah, the abomination! He has stolen our silver!"</P>

    The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes, and said gently to Madame Magloire:--</P>

    "And, in the first place, was that silver ours?"</P>

    Madame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the Bishop went on:--</P>

    "Madame Magloire, I have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man, evidently."</P>

    "Alas! Jesus!" returned Madame Magloire. "It is not for my sake, nor for Mademoiselle's. It makes no difference to us. But it is for the sake of Monseigneur. What is Monseigneur to eat with now?"</P>

    The Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement.</P>

    "Ah, come! Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?"</P>

    Madame Magloire shrugged her shoulders.</P>

    "Pewter has an odor."</P>

    "Iron forks and spoons, then."</P>

    Madame Magloire made an expressive grimace.</P>

    "Iron has a taste."</P>

    "Very well," said the Bishop; "wooden ones then."</P>

    A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which Jean Valjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast, Monseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, and to Madame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, that one really does not need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk.</P>

    "A pretty idea, truly," said Madame Magloire to herself, as she went and came, "to take in a man like that! and to lodge him close to one's self! And how fortunate that he did nothing but steal! Ah, mon Dieu! it makes one shudder to think of it!"</P>

    As the brother and sister were about to rise from the table, there came a knock at the door.</P>

    "Come in," said the Bishop.</P>

    The door opened. A singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. The three men were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.</P>

    A brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, was standing near the door. He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making a military salute.</P>

    "Monseigneur--" said he.</P>

    At this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed, raised his head with an air of stupefaction.</P>

    "Monseigneur!" he murmured. "So he is not the cure?"</P>

    "Silence!" said the gendarme. "He is Monseigneur the Bishop."</P>

    In the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great age permitted.</P>

    "Ah! here you are!" he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean. "I am glad to see you. Well, but how is this? I gave you the candlesticks too, which are of silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs. Why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons?"</P>

    Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of.</P>

    "Monseigneur," said the brigadier of gendarmes, "so what this man said is true, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man who is running away. We stopped him to look into the matter. He had this silver--"</P>

    "And he told you," interposed the Bishop with a smile, "that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him back here? It is a mistake."</P>

    "In that case," replied the brigadier, "we can let him go?"</P>

    "Certainly," replied the Bishop.</P>

    The gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled.</P>

    "Is it true that I am to be released?" he said, in an almost inarticulate voice, and as though he were talking in his sleep.</P>

    "Yes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?" said one of the gendarmes.</P>

    "My friend," resumed the Bishop, "before you go, here are your candlesticks. Take them."</P>

    He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, and brought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering a word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the Bishop.</P>

    Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks mechanically, and with a bewildered air.</P>

    "Now," said the Bishop, "go in peace. By the way, when you return, my friend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always enter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with anything but a latch, either by day or by night."</P>

    Then, turning to the gendarmes:--</P>

    "You may retire, gentlemen."</P>

    The gendarmes retired.</P>

    Jean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.</P>

    The Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:--</P>

    "Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man."</P>

    Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything, remained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered them. He resumed with solemnity:--</P>

    "Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God."</P>

    次日破晓，卞福汝主教在他的园中散步。马格洛大娘慌慌张张地向他跑来。</P>

    “我的主教，我的主教，”她喊着说，“大人可知道那只银器篮子在什么地方吗？”</P>

    “知道的。”主教说。</P>

    “耶稣上帝有灵！”她说。“我刚才还说它到什么地方去了呢。”</P>

    主教刚在花坛脚下拾起了那篮子，把它交给马格洛大娘。</P>

    “篮子在这儿。”</P>

    “怎样？”她说。“里面一点东西也没有！那些银器呢？”</P>

    “呀，”主教回答说，“您原来是问银器吗？我不知道在什么地方。”</P>

    “大哉好上帝！给人偷去了！是昨天晚上那个人偷了的！”</P>

    一转瞬间，马格洛大娘已用急躁老太婆的全部敏捷劲儿跑进祈祷室，穿进壁厢，又回到主教那儿。</P>

    主教正弯下腰去，悼惜一株被那篮子压折的秋海棠，那是篮子从花坛落到地下把它压折了的。主教听到马格洛大娘的叫声，又立起立。</P>

    “我的主教，那个人已经走了！银器也偷去了。”</P>

    她一面嚷，眼睛却落在园子的一角上，那儿还看得出越墙的痕迹。墙上的垛子也弄掉了一个。</P>

    “您瞧！他是从那儿逃走的。他跳进了车网巷！呀！可耻的东西！他偷了我们的银器！”</P>

    主教沉默了一会，随后他张开那双严肃的眼睛，柔声向马格洛大娘说：</P>

    “首先，那些银器难道真是我们的吗？”</P>

    马格洛大娘不敢说下去了。又是一阵沉寂。随后，主教继续说：</P>

    “马格洛大娘，我占用那些银器已经很久了。那是属于穷人的。那个人是什么人呢？当然是个穷人了。”</P>

    “耶稣，”马格洛大娘又说，“不是为了我，也不是为了姑娘，我们是没有关系的。但是我是为了我的主教着想。我的主教现在用什么东西盛饭菜呢？”</P>

    主教显出一副惊奇的神气瞧着她。</P>

    “呀！这话怎讲！我们不是有锡器吗？”</P>

    马格洛大娘耸了耸肩。</P>

    “锡器有一股臭气。”</P>

    “那么，铁器也可以。”</P>

    马格洛大娘做出一副怪样子：</P>

    “铁器有一股怪味。”</P>

    “那么，”主教说，“用木器就是了。”</P>

    过了一会，他坐在昨晚冉阿让坐过的那张桌子边用早餐。卞福汝主教一面吃，一面欢欢喜喜地叫他那哑口无言的妹子和叽哩咕噜的马格洛大娘注意，他把一块面包浸在牛奶里，连木匙和木叉也都不用。</P>

    “真想不到！”马格洛大娘一面走来走去，一面自言自语，“招待这样一个人，并且让他睡在自己的旁边！幸而他只偷了一点东西！我的上帝！想想都使人寒毛直竖。”</P>

    正在兄妹俩要离开桌子时，有人敲门。</P>

    “请进。”主教说。</P>

    门开了，一群狠巴巴的陌生人出现在门边。三个人拿着另一个人的衣领。那三个人是警察，另一个就是冉阿让。</P>

    一个警察队长，仿佛是率领那群人的，起先立在门边。他进来，行了个军礼，向主教走去。</P>

    “我的主教……”他说。</P>

    冉阿让先头好象是垂头丧气的，听了这称呼，忽然抬起头来，露出大吃一惊的神气。</P>

    “我的主教，”他低声说，“那么，他不是本堂神甫了……”</P>

    “不准开口！”一个警察说，“这是主教先生。”</P>

    但是卞福汝主教尽他的高年所允许的速度迎上去。</P>

    “呀！您来了！”他望着冉阿让大声说，“我真高兴看见您。怎么！那一对烛台，我也送给您了，那和其余的东西一样，都是银的，您可以变卖二百法郎。您为什么没有把那对烛台和餐具一同带去呢？”</P>

    冉阿让睁圆了眼睛，瞧着那位年高可敬的主教。他的面色，绝没有一种人类文字可以表达得出来。</P>

    “我的主教，”警察队长说，“难道这人说的话是真的吗？我们碰到了他。他走路的样子好象是个想逃跑的人。我们就把他拦下来看看。他拿着这些银器……”</P>

    “他还向你们说过，”主教笑容可掬地岔着说，“这些银器是一个神甫老头儿给他的，他还在他家里宿了一夜。我知道这是怎么回事。你们又把他带回到此地。对吗？你们误会了。”</P>

    “既是这样，”队长说，“我们可以把他放走吗？”</P>

    “当然。”主教回答说。</P>

    警察释放了冉阿让，他向后退了几步。</P>

    “你们真让我走吗？”他说，仿佛是在梦中，字音也几乎没有吐清楚。</P>

    “是的，我们让你走，你耳朵聋了吗？”一个警察说。</P>

    “我的朋友，”主教又说，“您在走之先，不妨把您的那对烛台拿去。”</P>

    他走到壁炉边，拿了那两个银烛台，送给冉阿让。那两个妇人没有说一个字、做一个手势或露一点神气去阻扰主教，她们瞧着他行动。</P>

    冉阿让全身发抖。他机械地接了那两个烛台，不知道怎样才好。</P>

    “现在，”主教说，“您可以放心走了。呀！还有一件事，我的朋友，您再来时，不必走园里。您随时都可以由街上的那扇门进出。白天和夜里，它都只上一个活闩。”</P>

    他转过去朝着那些警察：</P>

    “先生们，你们可以回去了。”</P>

    那些警察走了。</P>

    这时冉阿让象是个要昏倒的人。</P>

    主教走到他身边，低声向他说：</P>

    “不要忘记，永远不要忘记您允诺过我，您用这些银子是为了成为一个诚实的人。”</P>

    冉阿让绝对回忆不起他曾允诺过什么话，他呆着不能开口。主教说那些话是一字一字叮嘱的，他又郑重地说：“冉阿让，我的兄弟，您现在已不是恶一方面的人了，您是在善的一面了。我赎的是您的灵魂，我把它从黑暗的思想和自暴自弃的精神里救出来，交还给上帝。”</P>

 Part 1 Book 2 Chapter 13 LITTLE GERVAIS

    Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set out at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him, without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps. He wandered thus the whole morning, without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throng of novel sensations. He was conscious of a sort of rage; he did not know against whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated. There came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life. This state of mind fatigued him. He perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him. He asked himself what would replace this. At times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes, and that things should not have happened in this way; it would have agitated him less. Although the season was tolerably far advanced, there were still a few late flowers in the hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood. These memories were almost intolerable to him, it was so long since they had recurred to him.</P>

    Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.</P>

    As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on the horizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village. Jean Valjean might have been three leagues distant from D----A path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.</P>

    In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encountered him, a joyous sound became audible.</P>

    He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age, coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and his marmot-box on his back, One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers.</P>

    Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to time, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his hand--his whole fortune, probably.</P>

    Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.</P>

    The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, and tossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.</P>

    This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards the brushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.</P>

    Jean Valjean set his foot upon it.</P>

    In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him.</P>

    He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man. The spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there was not a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny, feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing the heavens at an immense height. The child was standing with his back to the sun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its blood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean.</P>

    "Sir," said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence, "my money."</P>

    "What is your name?" said Jean Valjean.</P>

    "Little Gervais, sir."</P>

    "Go away," said Jean Valjean.</P>

    "Sir," resumed the child, "give me back my money."</P>

    Jean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.</P>

    The child began again, "My money, sir."</P>

    Jean Valjean's eyes remained fixed on the earth.</P>

    "My piece of money!" cried the child, "my white piece! my silver!"</P>

    It seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him. The child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made an effort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his treasure.</P>

    "I want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!"</P>

    The child wept. Jean Valjean raised his head. He still remained seated. His eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement, then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice, "Who's there?"</P>

    "I, sir," replied the child. "Little Gervais! I! Give me back my forty sous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!"</P>

    Then irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:--</P>

    "Come now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, or we'll see!"</P>

    "Ah! It's still you!" said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to his feet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:--</P>

    "Will you take yourself off!"</P>

    The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head to foot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the top of his speed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.</P>

    Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own revery.</P>

    At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.</P>

    The sun had set.</P>

    The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten nothing all day; it is probable that he was feverish.</P>

    He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the child's flight. The breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals. His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All at once he shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.</P>

    He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel.</P>

    At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foot had half ground into the earth, and which was shining among the pebbles. It was as though he had received a galvanic shock. "What is this?" he muttered between his teeth. He recoiled three paces, then halted, without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before, as though the thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.</P>

    At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge.</P>

    He saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.</P>

    He said, "Ah!" and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, looked about him and saw nothing.</P>

    Then he shouted with all his might:--</P>

    "Little Gervais! Little Gervais!"</P>

    He paused and waited.</P>

    There was no reply.</P>

    The landscape was gloomy and deserted. He was encompassed by space. There was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost, and a silence which engulfed his voice.</P>

    An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury. One would have said that they were threatening and pursuing some one.</P>

    He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear, "Little Gervais! Little Gervais!"</P>

    Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed and would have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was no doubt already far away.</P>

    He encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him and said:--</P>

    "Monsieur le Cure, have you seen a child pass?"</P>

    "No," said the priest.</P>

    "One named Little Gervais?"</P>

    "I have seen no one."</P>

    He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the priest.</P>

    "Monsieur le Cure, this is for your poor people. Monsieur le Cure, he was a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and a hurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?"</P>

    "I have not seen him."</P>

    "Little Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?"</P>

    "If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. Such persons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them."</P>

    Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence, and gave them to the priest.</P>

    "For your poor," he said.</P>

    Then he added, wildly:--</P>

    "Monsieur l'Abbe, have me arrested. I am a thief."</P>

    The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.</P>

    Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first taken.</P>

    In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling, shouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where three paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. He sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, "Little Gervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!" His shout died away in the mist, without even awakening an echo. He murmured yet once more, "Little Gervais!" but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. It was his last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees, and he cried, "I am a wretch!"</P>

    Then his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years.</P>

    When Jean Valjean left the Bishop's house, he was, as we have seen, quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man. "You have promised me to become an honest man. I buy your soul. I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the good God."</P>

    This recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness he opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and which pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.</P>

    In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at D----? Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longer remained a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than the convict; that if he wished to become good be must become an angel; that if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?</P>

    Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought, in a confused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does form the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful whether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses of, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion. On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremors and anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an owl, who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and blinded, as it were, by virtue.</P>

    That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was no longer the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him.</P>

    In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbed him of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could not have explained it; was this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,-- a remnant of impulse, a result of what is called in statics, acquired force? It was that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that. Let us say it simply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast, who, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money, while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto unheard-of thoughts besetting it.</P>

    When intelligence re-awakened and beheld that action of the brute, Jean Valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.</P>

    It was because,--strange phenomenon, and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself,--in stealing the money from that child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.</P>

    However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect on him; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, and dispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other the light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other.</P>

    First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, all bewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the fact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when he exclaimed "I am a wretch!" he had just perceived what he was, and he was already separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had, there before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean Valjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage, with his thoughts filled with abominable projects.</P>

    Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort a visionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw that Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was, and he was horrified by him.</P>

    His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality. One no longer beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, as though apart from one's self, the figures which one has in one's own mind.</P>

    Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the same time, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch. On scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention, he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the Bishop.</P>

    His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,-- the Bishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required to soften the second. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his revery continued, as the Bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean grow less and vanish. After a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade. All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone remained; he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance.</P>

    Jean Valjean wept for a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed with more weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.</P>

    As he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; an extraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His past life, his first fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness, his internal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop's, the last thing that he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime all the more cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come after the Bishop's pardon,--all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed. He examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his soul, and it seemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light rested over this life and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the light of Paradise.</P>

    How many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept? Whither did he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to be authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served Grenoble at that epoch, and who arrived at D---- about three o'clock in the morning, saw, as he traversed the street in which the Bishop's residence was situated, a man in the attitude of prayer, kneeling on the pavement in the shadow, in front of the door of Monseigneur Welcome.</P>

    冉阿让逃也似的出了城。他在田亩中仓皇乱窜，不问大路小路，遇着就走，也不觉得他老在原处兜圈子。他那样瞎跑了一早晨，没吃东西，也不知道饿。他被一大堆新的感触控制住了。他觉得自己怒不可遏，却又不知道怒为谁发。他说不出他是受了感动还是受了侮辱。有时他觉得心头有一种奇特的柔和滋味，他却和它抗拒，拿了他过去二十年中立志顽抗到底的心情来对抗。这种情形使他感到疲乏。过去使他受苦的那种不公平的处罚早已使他决心为恶，现在他觉得那种决心动摇了，反而感到不安。他问自己：以后将用什么志愿来代替那种决心？有时，他的确认为假使没有这些经过，他仍能和警察相处狱中，他也许还高兴些，他心中也就可以少起一些波动。当时虽然已近岁暮，可是在青树篱中，三三两两，偶然也还有几朵晚开的花，他闻到花香，触起了童年的许多往事。那些往事对他几乎是不堪回首的，他已有那么多年不去想它了。</P>

    因此，那一天，有许许多多莫名其妙的感触一齐涌上他的心头。</P>

    正当落日西沉、地面上最小的石子也拖着细长的影子时，冉阿让坐在一片绝对荒凉的红土平原中的一丛荆棘后面。远处，只望见阿尔卑斯山。连远村的钟楼也瞧不见一个。冉阿让离开迪涅城大致已有三法里了。在离开荆棘几步的地方，横着一条穿过平原的小路。</P>

    他正在胡思乱想，当时如果有人走来，见了他那种神情，必然会感到他那身褴褛衣服格外可怕。正在那时，他忽然听到一阵欢乐的声音。</P>

    他转过头，看见一个十岁左右的穷孩子顺着小路走来，嘴里唱着歌，腰间一只摇琴，背上一只田鼠笼子，这是一个那种嬉皮笑脸、四乡游荡、从裤腿窟窿里露出膝头的孩子中的一个。</P>

    那孩子一面唱，一面又不时停下来，拿着手中的几个钱，做“抓子儿”游戏，那几个钱，大致就是他的全部财产了。里面有一个值四十苏的钱。</P>

    孩子停留在那丛荆棘旁边，没有看见冉阿让，把他的一把钱抛起来，他相当灵巧，每次都个个接在手背上。</P>

    可是这一次他那个值四十苏的钱落了空，向那丛荆棘滚了去，滚到了冉阿让的脚边。</P>

    冉阿让一脚踏在上面。</P>

    可是那孩子的眼睛早随着那个钱，他看见冉阿让用脚踏着。</P>

    他一点也不惊慌，直向那人走去。</P>

    那是一处绝对没有人的地方。在视线所及的范围内，绝没有一个人在平原和小路上。他们只听见一群掠空而过的飞鸟从高空送来微弱的鸣声。那孩子背朝太阳，日光把他的头发照成缕缕金丝，用血红的光把冉阿让的凶悍的脸照成紫色。</P>

    “先生，”那穷孩子用蒙昧和天真合成的赤子之心说，“我的钱呢？”</P>

    “你叫什么？”冉阿让说。</P>

    “小瑞尔威，先生。”</P>

    “滚！”冉阿让说。</P>

    “先生，”那孩子又说，“请您把我的那个钱还我。”</P>

    冉阿让低下头，不答话。</P>

    那孩子再说：</P>

    “我的钱，先生！”</P>

    冉阿让的眼睛仍旧盯在地上。</P>

    “我的钱！”那孩子喊起来，“我的白角子！我的银钱！”</P>

    冉阿让好象全没听见。那孩子抓住他的布衫领，推他。同时使劲推开那只压在他宝贝上面的铁钉鞋。</P>

    “我要我的钱！我要我值四十个苏的钱！”</P>

    孩子哭起来了。冉阿让抬起头，仍旧坐着不动。他眼睛的神气是迷糊不清的。他望着那孩子有点感到惊奇，随后，他伸手到放棍子的地方，大声喊道：</P>

    “谁在那儿？”</P>

    “是我，先生，”那孩子回答，“小瑞尔威。我！我！请您把我的四十个苏还我！把您的脚拿开，先生，求求您！”</P>

    他年纪虽小，却动了火，几乎有要硬干的神气：</P>

    “哈！您究竟拿开不拿开您的脚？快拿开您的脚！听见了没有？”</P>

    “呀！又是你！”冉阿让说。</P>

    随后，他忽然站起来，脚仍旧踏在银币上，接着说：</P>

    “你究竟走不走！”</P>

    那孩子吓坏了，望着他，继而从头到脚哆嗦起来，发了一会呆，逃了，他拚命跑，不敢回头，也不敢叫。</P>

    但是他跑了一程过后，喘不过气了，只得停下来。冉阿让在紊乱的心情中听到了他的哭声。</P>

    过一会，那孩子不见了。</P>

    太阳也落下去了。</P>

    黑暗渐渐笼罩着冉阿让的四周。他整天没有吃东西，他也许正在发寒热。</P>

    他仍旧立着，自从那孩子逃走以后，他还没有改变他那姿势。他的呼吸，忽长忽促，胸膛随着起伏。他的眼睛盯在他前面一二十步的地方，仿佛在专心研究野草中的一块碎蓝瓷片的形状。</P>

    忽然，他哆嗦了一下，此刻他才感到夜寒。</P>

    他重新把他的鸭舌帽压紧在额头上，机械地动手去把他的布衫拉拢，扣上，走了一步，弯下腰去，从地上拾起他的棍子。</P>

    这时，他忽然看见了那个值四十个苏的钱，他的脚已把它半埋在土中了，它在石子上发出闪光。</P>

    这一下好象是触着电似的，“这是什么东西？”他咬紧牙齿说。他向后退了三步，停下来，无法把他的视线从刚才他脚踏着的那一点移开，在黑暗里闪光的那件东西，仿佛是一只盯着他的大眼睛。</P>

    几分钟过后，他慌忙向那银币猛扑过去，捏住它，立起身来，向平原的远处望去，把目光投向天边四处，站着发抖，好象一只受惊以后要找地方藏身的猛兽。</P>

    他什么也瞧不见。天黑了，平原一片苍凉。紫色的浓雾正在黄昏的微光中腾起。他说了声“呀”，急忙向那孩子逃跑的方向走去。走了百来步以后，他停下来，向前望去，可是什么也看不见。</P>

    于是他使出全身力气，喊道：</P>

    “小瑞尔威！小瑞尔威！”</P>

    他住口细听。没有人回答。</P>

    那旷野是荒凉凄黯的。四周一望无际，全是荒地。除了那望不穿的黑影和叫不破的寂静以外，一无所有。</P>

    一阵冷峭的北风吹来，使他四周的东西都呈现出愁惨的景象。几棵矮树，摇着枯枝，带有一种不可思议的愤怒，仿佛要恐吓追扑什么人似的。</P>

    他再往前走，随后又跑起来，跑跑停停，在那寂寥的原野上，吼出他那无比凄惨惊人的声音：</P>

    “小瑞尔威！小瑞尔威！”</P>

    如果那孩子听见了，也一定会害怕，会好好地躲起来。不过那孩子，毫无疑问，已经走远了。</P>

    他遇见一个骑马的神甫。他走到他身边，向他说：</P>

    “神甫先生，您看见一个孩子走过去吗？”</P>

    “没有。”神甫说。</P>

    “一个叫小瑞尔威的？”</P>

    “我谁也没看见。”</P>

    他从他钱袋里取出两枚五法郎的钱，交给神甫。</P>

    “神甫先生，这是给您的穷人的。神甫先生，他是一个十岁左右的孩子，他有一只田鼠笼子，我想，还有一把摇琴。他是向那个方向走去的。他是一个通烟囱的穷孩子，您知道吗？”</P>

    “我确实没有看见。”</P>

    “小瑞尔威？他不是这村子里的吗？您能告诉我吗？”</P>

    “如果他是象您那么说的，我的朋友，那就是一个从别处来的孩子了。他们经过这里，却不会有人认识他们。”</P>

    冉阿让另又拿出两个五法郎的钱交给神甫。</P>

    “给您的穷人。”他说。</P>

    随后他又迷乱地说：</P>

    “教士先生，您去叫人来捉我吧。我是一个窃贼。”</P>

    神甫踢动双腿，催马前进，魂飞天外似的逃了。</P>

    冉阿让又朝着他先头预定的方向跑去。</P>

    他那样走了许多路，张望，叫喊，呼号，但是再也没有碰见一个人。他在那原野里，看见一点象是卧着或蹲着的东西，他就跑过去，那样前后有两三次，他见到的只是一些野草，或是露在地面上的石头，最后，他走到一个三岔路口，停下来。月亮出来了。他张望远处，作了最后一次的呼唤：“小瑞尔威！小瑞尔威！小瑞尔威！”他的呼声在暮霭中消失，连回响也没有了。他嘴里还念着：“小瑞尔威！”但是声音微弱，几乎不成字音。那是他最后的努力，他的膝弯忽然折下，仿佛他良心上的负担已成了一种无形的威力突然把他压倒了似的，他精疲力竭，倒在一块大石头上，两手握着头发，脸躲在膝头中间，他喊道：</P>

    “我是一个无赖！”</P>

    他的心碎了，他哭了出来，那是他第一次流泪。</P>

    冉阿让从主教家里出来时，我们看得出来，他已完全摆脱了从前的那种思想。不过他一时还不能分辨自己的心情。他对那个老人的仁言懿行还强自抗拒。“您允诺了我做诚实人。我赎买了您的灵魂，我把它从污秽当中救出来交给慈悲的上帝。”这些话不停地回到他的脑子里。他用自己的傲气来和那种至高无上的仁德对抗，傲气真是我们心里的罪恶堡垒。他仿佛觉得，神甫的原有是使他回心转意的一种最大的迫击和最凶猛的攻势，如果他对那次恩德还要抵抗，那他就会死硬到底，永不回头；如果他屈服，他就应当放弃这许多年来别人种在他心里、也是他自鸣得意的那种仇恨。那一次是他的胜败关头，那种斗争，那种关系着全盘胜负的激烈斗争，已在他自身的凶恶和那人的慈善间展开了。</P>

    他怀着一种一知半解的心情，醉汉似的往前走。当他那样惝恍迷离往前走时，他对这次在迪涅的意外遭遇给他的后果是否有一种明确的认识呢？在人生的某些时刻，常有一种神秘的微音来惊觉或搅扰我们的心神，他是否也听到过这种微音呢？是否有种声音在他的耳边说他正在经历他生命中最严重的一刻呢？他已没有中立的余地，此后他如果不做最好的人，就会做最恶的人，现在他应当超过主教（不妨这样说），否则就会堕落到连苦役犯也不如，如果他情愿为善，就应当做天使，如果他甘心为恶，就一定做恶魔。</P>

    在此地，我们应当再提出我们曾在别处提出过的那些问题，这一切在他的思想上是否多少发生了一点影响呢？当然，我们曾经说过，艰苦的生活能教育人，能启发人，但是在冉阿让那种水平上，他是否能分析我们在此地指出的这一切，那却是一个疑问，如果他对那些思想能有所体会，那也只是一知半解，他一定看不清楚，并且那些思想也只能使他堕入一种烦恼，使他感到难堪，几乎感到痛苦。他从所谓牢狱的那种畸形而黑暗的东西里出来后，主教已伤了他的灵魂，正如一种太强烈的光会伤他那双刚从黑暗中出来的眼睛一样。将来的生活，摆在他眼前的那种永远纯洁、光彩、完全可能实现的生活，使他战栗惶感。他确实不知道怎么办。正如一只骤见日出的枭乌，这个罪犯也因见了美德而目眩，并且几乎失明。</P>

    有一点可以肯定，并且是他自己也相信的，那就是他已不是从前那个人了，他的心完全变了，他已没有能力再去做主教不曾和他谈到也不曾触及的那些事了。</P>

    在这样的思想状况下，他遇到了小瑞尔威，抢了他的四十个苏。那是为什么？他一定不能说明，难道这是他从监牢里带来的那种恶念的最后影响，好比临终的振作，冲动的余力，力学里所谓“惯性”的结果吗？是的。也许还不完全是。我们简单地说说，抢东西的并不是他，并不是他这个人，而是那只兽，当时他心里有那么多初次感到的苦恼，正当他作思想斗争时，那只兽，由于习惯和本能作用，便不自觉地把脚踏在那钱上了。等到心智清醒以后，看见了那种兽类的行为，冉阿让才感到痛心，向后退却，并且惊骇到大叫起来。</P>

    抢那孩子的钱，那已不是他下得了手的事，那次的非常现象只是在他当时的思想情况下才有发生的可能。</P>

    无论如何，这最后一次恶劣的行为对他起了一种决定性的效果。这次的恶劣行为突然穿过他的混乱思想并加以澄清，把黑暗的障碍置在一边，光明置在另一边，并且按照他当时的思想水平，影响他的心灵，正如某些化学反应体对一种混浊的混合物发生作用时的情况一样，它能使一种原素沉淀，另一种澄清。</P>

    最初，在自我检查和思考之先，他登时心情慌乱，正如一个逃命的人，狠命追赶，要找出那个孩子把钱还给他；后来等到他明白已经太迟，不可能追上时，他才大失所望，停了下来。当他喊着“我是一个无赖”时，他才看出自己是怎样一个人，在那时，他已离开他自己，仿佛觉得他自己只是一个鬼，并且看见那个有肉有骨、形相丑恶的苦役犯冉阿让就立在他面前，手里拿着棍，腰里围着布衫，背上的布袋里装满了偷来的东西，面目果决而忧郁，脑子里充满卑劣的阴谋。</P>

    我们已指出过，过分的痛苦使他成了一个多幻想的人，那正好象是一种幻境，他确实看见了冉阿让的那副凶恶面孔出现在他前面。他几乎要问他自己那个人是谁，并且对他起了强烈的反感。</P>

    人在幻想中，有时会显得沉静到可怕，继而又强烈地激动起来，惑于幻想的人，往往无视于实际，冉阿让当时的情况，正是那样。他看不见自己周围的东西，却仿佛看见心里的人物出现在自己的前面。</P>

    我们可以这样说，他正望着他自己，面面相觑，并且同时通过那种幻景，在一种神妙莫测的深远处看见一点光，起初他还以为是什么火炬，等到他再仔细去看那一点显现在他良心上的光时，他才看出那火炬似的光具有人形，并且就是那位主教。</P>

    他的良心再三再四地研究那样立在他面前的两个人，主教和冉阿让。要驯服第二个就非第一个不行。由于那种痴望所特具的奇异效力，他的幻想延续越久，主教的形象也越高大，越在他眼前显得光辉灿烂，冉阿让却越来越小，也越来越模糊。到某一时刻他已只是个影子。忽然一下，他完全消失了。</P>

    只剩下那个主教。</P>

    他让烂灿光辉充实了那个可怜人的全部心灵。</P>

    冉阿让哭了许久，淌着热泪，痛不成声，哭得比妇女更柔弱，比孩子更慌乱。</P>

    正在他哭时，光明逐渐在他脑子里出现了，一种奇特的光，一种极其可爱同时又极其可怕的光。他已往的生活，最初的过失，长期的赎罪，外貌的粗俗，内心的顽强，准备在出狱后痛痛快快报复一番的种种打算，例如在主教家里干的事，他最后干的事，抢了那孩子的四十个苏的那一次罪行，并且这次罪行是犯在获得主教的宥免以后，那就更加无耻，更加丑恶；凡此种种都回到了他脑子里，清清楚楚地显现出来，那种光的明亮是他生平从未见过的。他回顾他的生活，丑恶已极，他的心灵，卑鄙不堪。但是在那种生活和心灵上面有一片和平的光。</P>

    他好象是在天堂的光里看见了魔鬼。</P>

    他那样哭了多少时间呢？哭过以后，他做了些什么呢？他到什么地方去了呢？从来没有人知道。但有一件事似乎是可靠的，就是在那天晚上，有辆去格勒诺布尔的车子，在早晨三点左右到了迪涅，在经过主教院街时，车夫曾看见一个人双膝跪在卞福汝主教大门外的路旁，仿佛是在黑暗里祈铸。</P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 1 The Year 1817

    1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance which was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. It is the year in which M. Bruguiere de Sorsum was celebrated. All the hairdressers' shops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird, were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in the church-warden's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, in his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action. The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this: being mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d'Angouleme. Hence his peerage. In 1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. The French army was dressed in white, after the mode of the Austrian; the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers they bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and since England refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, and the Abbe Louis, appointed minister of finance, laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the two augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might have been seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with traces of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. These were the columns which two years before had upheld the Emperor's platform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and there with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had this remarkable point: that it had been held in the month of June and in the Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box a la Charter. The most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother's head into the fountain of the Flower-Market.</P>

    They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account of the lack of news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, which was destined to cover Chaumareix with infamy and Gericault with glory. Colonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace of Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On the platform of the octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little shed of boards, which had served as an observatory to Messier, the naval astronomer under Louis XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse de Duras read to three or four friends her unpublished Ourika, in her boudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue satin. The N's were scratched off the Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of the King's Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, which disguised the bridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis XVIII., much preoccupied while annotating Horace with the corner of his finger-nail, heroes who have become emperors, and makers of wooden shoes who have become dauphins, had two anxieties,--Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy had given for its prize subject, The Happiness procured through Study. M. Bellart was officially eloquent. In his shadow could be seen germinating that future advocate-general of Broe, dedicated to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. There was a false Chateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim, until there should be a false Marchangy, named d'Arlincourt. Claire d'Albe and Malek-Adel were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of the epoch. The Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken from its list of members. A royal ordinance erected Angouleme into a naval school; for the Duc d'Angouleme, being lord high admiral, it was evident that the city of Angouleme had all the qualities of a seaport; otherwise the monarchical principle would have received a wound. In the Council of Ministers the question was agitated whether vignettes representing slack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi's advertising posters, and which attracted throngs of street urchins, should be tolerated. M. Paer, the author of Agnese, a good sort of fellow, with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the little private concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l'Eveque. All the young girls were singing the Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with words by Edmond Geraud. The Yellow Dwarf was transferred into Mirror. The Cafe Lemblin stood up for the Emperor, against the Cafe Valois, which upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de Berri, already surveyed from the shadow by Louvel, had just been married to a princess of Sicily. Madame de Stael had died a year previously. The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars. The grand newspapers were all very small. Their form was restricted, but their liberty was great. The Constitutionnel was constitutional. La Minerve called Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. That t made the good middle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the great writer. In journals which sold themselves, prostituted journalists, insulted the exiles of 1815. David had no longer any talent, Arnault had no longer any wit, Carnot was no longer honest, Soult had won no battles; it is true that Napoleon had no longer any genius. No one is ignorant of the fact that letters sent to an exile by post very rarely reached him, as the police made it their religious duty to intercept them. This is no new fact; Descartes complained of it in his exile. Now David, having, in a Belgian publication, shown some displeasure at not receiving letters which had been written to him, it struck the royalist journals as amusing; and they derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. What separated two men more than an abyss was to say, the regicides, or to say the voters; to say the enemies, or to say the allies; to say Napoleon, or to say Buonaparte. All sensible people were agreed that the era of revolution had been closed forever by King Louis XVIII., surnamed "The Immortal Author of the Charter." On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, the word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal that awaited the statue of Henry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Therese, No. 4, was making the rough draft of his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of the Right said at grave conjunctures, "We must write to Bacot." MM. Canuel, O'Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, to some extent with Monsieur's approval, of what was to become later on "The Conspiracy of the Bord de l'Eau"--of the waterside. L'Epingle Noire was already plotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring with Trogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand stood every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers, and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist's instruments spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which were charming, while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter to M. Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone, preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Feletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmann signed himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote Therese Aubert. Divorce was abolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. The collegians, decorated on the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other apropos of the King of Rome. The counter-police of the chateau had denounced to her Royal Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the Duc d'Orleans, who made a better appearance in his uniform of a colonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform of colonel-general of dragoons-- a serious inconvenience. The city of Paris was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense. Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such or such an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M. Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. The comedian Picard, who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Moliere had not been able to do, had The Two Philiberts played at the Odeon, upon whose pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OF THE EMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The Liberal, Pelicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the following title: Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy. "That will attract purchasers," said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M. Charles Loyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning to gnaw at him--a sign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:--</P>

    "Even when Loyson steals, one feels that he has paws."</P>

    As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie, administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of Dappes was begun between Switzerland and France by a memoir from Captain, afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting his sublime dream. There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science, whom posterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure Fourier, whom the future will recall. Lord Byron was beginning to make his mark; a note to a poem by Millevoye introduced him to France in these terms: a certain Lord Baron. David d'Angers was trying to work in marble. The Abbe Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private gathering of seminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown priest, named Felicite-Robert, who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. A thing which smoked and clattered on the Seine with the noise of a swimming dog went and came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis XV.; it was a piece of mechanism which was not good for much; a sort of plaything, the idle dream of a dream-ridden inventor; an utopia--a steamboat. The Parisians stared indifferently at this useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute by a coup d'etat, the distinguished author of numerous academicians, ordinances, and batches of members, after having created them, could not succeed in becoming one himself. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the pavilion de Marsan wished to have M. Delaveau for prefect of police, on account of his piety. Dupuytren and Recamier entered into a quarrel in the amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and threatened each other with their fists on the subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier, with one eye on Genesis and the other on nature, tried to please bigoted reaction by reconciling fossils with texts and by making mastodons flatter Moses.</P>

    M. Francois de Neufchateau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memory of Parmentier, made a thousand efforts to have pomme de terre [potato] pronounced parmentiere, and succeeded therein not at all. The Abbe Gregoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, had passed, in the royalist polemics, to the state of "Infamous Gregoire." The locution of which we have made use--passed to the state of--has been condemned as a neologism by M. Royer Collard. Under the third arch of the Pont de Jena, the new stone with which, the two years previously, the mining aperture made by Blucher to blow up the bridge had been stopped up, was still recognizable on account of its whiteness. Justice summoned to its bar a man who, on seeing the Comte d'Artois enter Notre Dame, had said aloud: "Sapristi! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma enter the Bel Sauvage, arm in arm." A seditious utterance. Six months in prison. Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over to the enemy on the eve of battle made no secret of their recompense, and strutted immodestly in the light of day, in the cynicism of riches and dignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness of their well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy in the most barefaced manner.</P>

    This is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, for the year 1817, and is now forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, and cannot do otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. Nevertheless, these details, which are wrongly called trivial,-- there are no trivial facts in humanity, nor little leaves in vegetation,--are useful. It is of the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries is composed. In this year of 1817 four young Parisians arranged "a fine farce."</P>

    一八一七是路易十八用那种目空一切的君王气魄称为他登极第二十二年①的那一年。也是布吕吉尔·德·沙松先生扬名的那一年。所有假发店老板一心希望扑粉和御鸟再出现，都刷上了天蓝色灰浆并画上了百合花。②这是蓝舒伯爵穿上法兰西世卿服装，佩着红绶带，挺着长鼻子，有着轰动一时的人物所具有的那种奇特侧影的威仪，以理事员身分每礼拜日坐在圣日耳曼·代·勃雷教堂的公凳上的承平时期。蓝舒伯爵的功绩是这样的：他在任波尔多③市长期内，一八一四年三月十二日那天，把城池献给了昂古莱姆公爵，凭这项轰轰烈烈的功勋，他就得了世卿的禄位。 </P>

    ①法国大革命在一七九三年推翻了君主专制，国王路易十六经国民公会判处死刑，王党奉路易十七（路易十六的儿子）为国王继承人，路易十七在一七九五年死在狱中，路易十六之弟路易十八被认为继承人，他是在一八一五年拿破仑逊位才回国登王位的，但是他不承认王室的统治是中断了的，认为他的王权应从一七九五年算起，所以一八一七年是他的统治的第二十二年。</P>

    ②百合花是法国波旁王朝的标志。贵族都戴假发，并以粉扑发为美。“御鸟”是一种髻的名称。</P>

    ③波尔多（Bordeaux），法国西南部滨大西洋的商业城市。拿破仑和英国争霸，封锁了大陆，商业资产阶级深感痛苦，一八一四年三月，英国军队从西班牙侵入法国南部时，他们把城池献给了敌人。昂古莱姆公爵是路易十八的侄儿，随着英国军队进入波尔多。</P>

    在一八一七年，四岁到六岁的男孩都戴一种极大的染色羊皮帽，成了风行一时的时装，帽子两旁有耳遮，颇象爱斯基摩人的高统帽。法国军队，仿奥地利式样，穿上了白军服，联队改称为驻防部队，不用番号，而冠以行省的名称。拿破仑还在圣赫勒拿岛，由于英国人不肯供应蓝呢布，他便翻穿旧衣服。在一八一七年，佩勒格利尼正歌唱，比戈第尼姑娘正跳舞，博基埃正红及一时，奥德利还没有出世。沙基夫人继福利奥佐①而起。在法国还有普鲁士人②。德拉洛先生③成了著名的人物。正统江山在斩了普勒尼埃、加尔波诺和托勒龙的手、又斩了他们的头④以后地位才宣告稳固。大臣塔列朗⑤王爷和钦命财政总长路易教士，好象两个巫师一样，相顾而笑⑥，他们两个都参加过一七九○年七月十四日在马尔斯广场举行的联邦弥撒，塔列朗以主教资格主祭，路易助祭。 </P>

    ①佩勒格利尼（Pellegrini），那不勒斯歌手，当时在巴黎演出。比戈第尼姑娘（Bigottini），当时的舞蹈家。博基埃（Potie），当时的喜剧演员。奥德利（Odry），喜剧演员。沙基夫人（MmeSaqui）和福利奥佐（Forioso），第一帝国时期最著名的杂技演员，走绳索者。</P>

    ②占领军在一八一八年才撤离法国。</P>

    ③德拉洛（Delalot，1772-1842），极端保王派，《辩论日报》的编辑。</P>

    ④普勒尼埃、加尔波诺、托勒龙，秘密会社社员，因赞成处死路易十六被处死。斩手又斩首是法国对弑王者的刑罚。</P>

    ⑤塔列朗（Talleyrand，1754-1838），公爵，原是拿破仑的外交大臣，一八○七年免职后勾结国外势力。一八一四年三月俄普联军攻入巴黎，塔列朗组织临时内阁，迎接路易十八回国。</P>

    ⑥巫师共同作弊，彼此心里明白，所以相顾而笑。</P>

    在一八一七年，就在那马尔斯广场旁边的小路上，发现了几根蓝漆大木柱倒在雨水和乱草里腐烂，柱上的金鹰和金蜂都褪了色，只剩下一点痕迹。那些柱子是两年前开五月会议①时搭建御用礼台用的。驻扎在大石头附近的奥地利军队的露营部队已把它们烧得遍体焦痕了。其中的两三根已被那些露营部队当作柴火烧掉了，并还烘过日耳曼皇军的巨掌。五月会议有这样一个特点，那就是五月会议是六月间在马尔斯广场上举行的。在一八一七年里，有两件事是人人知道的：伏尔泰－都格事件和鼻烟壶上刻的宪章问题。巴黎最新的骇人消息是杜丹的罪案，杜丹曾把他兄弟的脑袋丢在花市的水池里。海军部开始调查海船墨杜萨号事件，这使肖马勒蒙羞，热利果光采。塞尔夫上校赴埃及去做沙里蒙总督。竖琴街的浴宫做了一个修桶匠的店面。当时在克吕尼宅子的八角塔的平台上，还可以看见一间小木板房子，那是梅西埃的天文台，就是做过路易十六的海军天文宫的梅西埃。杜拉公爵夫人在她那间陈设了天蓝缎交叉式家具的客厅里对着三四个朋友朗诵她作的那篇未经发表的《舞力卡》。卢浮宫里的N②正被刮去。奥斯特里茨桥退位了，改名为御花园桥，那种双关的隐语把奥斯特里茨桥和植物园③都同时隐没了。路易十八拿起《贺拉斯》④，用指甲尖划着读，特别注意那些做皇帝的英雄和做王子的木鞋匠，因为他有双重顾虑：拿破仑和马蒂兰·布吕诺⑤。法兰西学院的征文题目是《读书乐》。伯拉先生经官府承认确有辩才。在他的培养下，未来的检察长德勃洛艾已初露头角，立志学习保尔－路易·古利埃的尖刻。那年有个冒充里昂⑥的马尚吉，随后又有个冒充马尚吉的达兰谷。《克勒尔·达尔伯》和《马勒克·亚岱尔》被称为两部杰作。歌丹夫人被推为当时的第一作家。法兰西学院任人把院士拿破仑·波拿巴从它的名册上除名。国王命令在昂古莱姆⑦设立海军学校，因为昂古莱姆公爵是个伟大的海军大臣，昂古莱姆城就必然具有海港的一切优越条件，否则君主制就失了体统了。法兰柯尼⑧在他的布告上加上一些有关骑术的插图，吸引了街上的野孩子，内阁会议曾经热烈讨论应否容许他那样做。巴埃先生，《亚尼丝阿》的作者，颊上生了一颗肉痣的方脸好人，常在主教城街沙塞南侯爵夫人家里布置小型家庭音乐会。所有的年轻姑娘都唱爱德蒙·热罗作词的《圣阿卫尔的隐者》。《黄矮子报》改成了《镜报》。朗布兰咖啡馆抬出皇帝来对抗那家拥护波旁王室的瓦洛亚咖啡馆。人家刚把西西里的一个公主嫁给那位已被卢韦尔⑨暗中注意的贝里公爵。 </P>

    ①五月会议是拿破仑于一八一五年召集的一种人民代表会议。</P>

    ②N是拿破仑的徽志。</P>

    ③巴黎植物园初建于十七世纪初，一七九三年起曾加扩建。</P>

    ④《贺拉斯》（Horace），高乃依根据罗马历史故事所作的悲剧。</P>

    ⑤马蒂兰·布吕诺（MathurinBruneau），当时名人之一，木鞋匠出身，所以路易十八对他心存戒心。</P>

    ⑥夏多布里昂（Chateaubriand，1768-1848），法国作家，消极浪漫主义文学的创始人。</P>

    ⑦昂古莱姆（Angouleme），城名，在内地，不在海滨。</P>

    ⑧法兰柯尼，一个养马官。</P>

    ⑨卢韦尔（Louve）是个制造马鞍的工人，他刺杀了贝里公爵，贝里公爵是路易十八的侄儿，杀他，是想绝王族之后。</P>

    斯达尔夫人①去世已一年。近卫军老喝马尔斯②小姐的倒彩。各种大报都只一点点大，篇幅缩小，但是自由还是大的。《立宪主义者报》是拥护宪政的。《密涅瓦报》把Chateaubriand（夏多布里昂）写成Chateaubriant。资产阶级借了写错了的那个t字大大嘲笑这位大作家。在一些被收买了的报纸里，有些妓女式的新闻记者辱骂那些在一八一五年被清洗的人们，大卫③已经没有才艺了，亚尔诺④已经没有文思了，卡诺⑤已经没有羞耻了，苏尔特⑥从来没有打过胜仗，拿破仑确也没有天才。大家都知道，通过邮局寄给一个被放逐的人的信件是很少寄到的，警察把截留那些信件作为他们的神圣任务。那种事由来已久，被放逐的笛卡儿⑦便诉过苦。大卫为了收不到他的信件在比利时的一家报纸上发了几句牢骚，引起了保王党报章的兴趣，借此机会，把那位被放逐者讥讽了一番。说“弑君犯”或“投票人”⑧，说“敌人”或“盟友”⑨，说“拿破仑”或“布宛纳巴”⑩，一字之差，可以在两人中造成一道鸿沟。 </P>

    ①斯达尔夫人（MadamedeStaeBl），浪漫主义作家。</P>

    ②马尔斯（Mars），喜剧演员。</P>

    ③大卫（David），油画家，曾任国民公会代表，继为拿破仑所器重。</P>

    ⑤卡诺（Carnot），数学家，国民公会代表，公安委员会委员，共和国十四军的创编者，一七九四年参加热月九日反革命政变。</P>

    ⑥苏尔特（Soult），拿破仑部下的元帅，奥斯特里茨一役居首功。</P>

    ⑦笛卡儿（Descartes，1569-1650），法国二元论哲学家。</P>

    ⑧指投票赞成斩决路易十六的代表。</P>

    ⑨指帮助波旁王室复辟的奥、英、俄、普等同盟国。</P>

    ⑩拿破仑是帝号。拿破仑姓Bonaparte（波拿巴），是由他原来的意大利姓Buonaparte（读如“布宛纳巴”），经过法国化后变成的。仇视他的人按照意大利语音叫他的姓，带有表示他不是法国土著的意思。</P>

    一切头脑清楚的人都认为这革命的世纪已被国王路易十八永远封闭了，他被称为“宪章的不朽的创作者”。在新桥的桥堍平地，准备建立亨利四世①铜像的石座上已经刻上“更生”两字。比艾先生在戴莱丝街四号筹备他的秘密会议，以图巩固君主制度。右派的领袖在严重关头，老是说：“我们应当写信给巴柯。”加奴埃、奥马阿尼、德·沙伯德兰诸人正策划日后所谓的“水滨阴谋”，他们多少征得了御弟②的同意。“黑别针”在另一方面也有所策动。德拉卫德里和特洛果夫正进行谈判。多少具有一些自由思想的德卡兹③先生正掌握实权。夏多布里昂每天早晨立在圣多米尼克街二十七号的窗子前面，穿着长裤和拖鞋，一条马德拉斯绸巾裹着他的灰白头发，眼睛望着一面镜子，全套牙科手术工具箱开在面前，修着他的美丽的牙齿，一面向他的书记毕洛瑞先生口述《君主与宪章》的诠言。权威批评家称赞拉封而不称赞塔尔马④。德·菲勒茨⑤先生签名A，霍夫曼⑥先生签Z。查理·诺缔埃⑦正创作《泰莱斯·阿贝尔》。离婚被禁止了。中学校改称中学堂。衣领上装一朵金质百合花的中学生因罗马王⑧问题互相斗殴。宫庭侦探向夫人殿下⑨递报告，说奥尔良公爵⑩的像四处悬挂，并说他穿轻骑将军制服的相貌比穿龙骑将军制服的贝里公爵还好看是件非常不妥的事。巴黎自筹经费把残废军人院的屋顶重行装了金。正派人彼此猜问：德·特兰克拉格先生在某种和某种情形下会怎样处理？克洛塞尔·德·蒙达尔先生和克洛塞尔·德·古塞格先生在许多方面意见分歧，德·沙拉伯利先生不得意。喜剧家比加尔，戏剧学院（喜剧家莫里哀也不曾当选的那个戏剧学院）的院士，在奥德翁戏院公演《两个菲力浦》，在那戏院的大门头上，揭去了的字还显明地露着“皇后戏院”的字迹。有些人对古涅·德·蒙达洛的态度不一致。法布维埃是暴动分子，巴武是革命党人。贝里西埃书店印行了一部伏尔泰文集，题名为《法兰西学院院士伏尔泰文集》。那位天真的发行人说：“这样做可以招引买主”。一般舆论认为查理·罗丛先生是本世纪的天才，他已开始受人羡慕，那是光荣的预兆，并且有人为他写了一句这样的诗：</P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 2 A Double Quartette

    These Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, the third from Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they were students; and when one says student, one says Parisian: to study in Paris is to be born in Paris.</P>

    These young men were insignificant; every one has seen such faces; four specimens of humanity taken at random; neither good nor bad, neither wise nor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; handsome, with that charming April which is called twenty years. They were four Oscars; for, at that epoch, Arthurs did not yet exist. Burn for him the perfumes of Araby! exclaimed romance. Oscar advances. Oscar, I shall behold him! People had just emerged from Ossian; elegance was Scandinavian and Caledonian; the pure English style was only to prevail later, and the first of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the battle of Waterloo.</P>

    These Oscars bore the names, one of Felix Tholomyes, of Toulouse; the second, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; the last, Blachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them had his mistress. Blachevelle loved Favourite, so named because she had been in England; Listolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of a flower; Fameuil idolized Zephine, an abridgment of Josephine; Tholomyes had Fantine, called the Blonde, because of her beautiful, sunny hair.</P>

    Favourite, Dahlia, Zephine, and Fantine were four ravishing young women, perfumed and radiant, still a little like working-women, and not yet entirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by intrigues, but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil, and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall in woman. One of the four was called the young, because she was the youngest of them, and one was called the old; the old one was twenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three first were more experienced, more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of life than Fantine the Blonde, who was still in her first illusions.</P>

    Dahlia, Zephine, and especially Favourite, could not have said as much. There had already been more than one episode in their romance, though hardly begun; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, and Gustave in the third. Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; one scolds and the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side. These badly guarded souls listen. Hence the falls which they accomplish, and the stones which are thrown at them. They are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible. Alas! what if the Jungfrau were hungry?</P>

    Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zephine. She had had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a braggart, who went out to give lessons in spite of his age. This professor, when he was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid's gown catch on a fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident. The result had been Favourite. She met her father from time to time, and he bowed to her. One morning an old woman with the air of a devotee, had entered her apartments, and had said to her, "You do not know me, Mamemoiselle?" "No." "I am your mother." Then the old woman opened the sideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she owned brought in, and installed herself. This cross and pious old mother never spoke to Favourite, remained hours without uttering a word, breakfasted, dined, and supped for four, and went down to the porter's quarters for company, where she spoke ill of her daughter.</P>

    It was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn Dahlia to Listolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could she make such nails work? She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands. As for Zephine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish and caressing little way of saying "Yes, sir."</P>

    The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends. Such loves are always accompanied by such friendships.</P>

    Goodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof of this is that, after making all due allowances for these little irregular households, Favourite, Zephine, and Dahlia were philosophical young women, while Fantine was a good girl.</P>

    Good! some one will exclaim; and Tholomyes? Solomon would reply that love forms a part of wisdom. We will confine ourselves to saying that the love of Fantine was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.</P>

    She alone, of all the four, was not called "thou" by a single one of them.</P>

    Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the dregs of the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the unknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents? Who can say? She had never known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why Fantine? She had never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directory still existed. She had no family name; she had no family; no baptismal name; the Church no longer existed. She bore the name which pleased the first random passer-by, who had encountered her, when a very small child, running bare-legged in the street. She received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained. She was called little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This human creature had entered life in just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood. At fifteen she came to Paris "to seek her fortune." Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure as long as she could. She was a lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had gold and pearls for her dowry; but her gold was on her head, and her pearls were in her mouth.</P>

    She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,-- for the heart, also, has its hunger,--she loved.</P>

    She loved Tholomyes.</P>

    An amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter, filled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning of their dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyes in the mazes of the hill of the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but in such a way as constantly to encounter him again. There is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.</P>

    Blachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of which Tholomyes was the head. It was he who possessed the wit.</P>

    Tholomyes was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income of four thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid scandal on Mount Sainte-Genevieve. Tholomyes was a fast man of thirty, and badly preserved. He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of a bald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, the skull at thirty, the knee at forty. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been attacked by a watering in one eye. But in proportion as his youth disappeared, gayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth with buffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony, his weeping eye laughed incessantly. He was dilapidated but still in flower. His youth, which was packing up for departure long before its time, beat a retreat in good order, bursting with laughter, and no one saw anything but fire. He had had a piece rejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few verses now and then. In addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree, which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak. Being thus ironical and bald, he was the leader. Iron is an English word. Is it possible that irony is derived from it?</P>

    One day Tholomyes took the three others aside, with the gesture of an oracle, and said to them:--</P>

    "Fantine, Dahlia, Zephine, and Favourite have been teasing us for nearly a year to give them a surprise. We have promised them solemnly that we would. They are forever talking about it to us, to me in particular, just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius, `Faccia gialluta, fa o miracolo, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,' so our beauties say to me incessantly, `Tholomyes, when will you bring forth your surprise?' At the same time our parents keep writing to us. Pressure on both sides. The moment has arrived, it seems to me; let us discuss the question."</P>

    Thereupon, Tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something so mirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four mouths simultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, "That is an idea."</P>

    A smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.</P>

    The result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took place on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the four young girls.</P>

    上述的那些巴黎青年中，有一个是图卢兹人，一个是利摩日人，第三个是卡奥尔人，第四个是蒙托邦人，不过他们都是学生，凡是学生，都是巴黎人，在巴黎求学，便算生在巴黎。</P>

    他们都是一些无足称道的青年，谁都见过这一类的人，四种庸俗人的标本，既不善，也不恶，既无学问，又非无知，既非天才，亦非笨伯，年方二十，美如妩媚的阳春。这是四个毫不出奇的奥斯卡尔①，因为在那时代，阿瑟②还没有出世。当时的歌谣说：“为了他，点上龙涎香，奥斯卡尔走上前来，奥斯卡尔，我要去看他！”大家已放下了《欧辛集》③。姿态的俊美崇尚的是斯堪的纳维亚式和苏格兰式。纯粹英国式要到以后才风行，并且阿瑟派的头号人物威灵顿得逞于滑铁卢战役还没有多少时候。 </P>

    ①奥斯卡尔（Oscar），瑞典和挪威国王，一七九九年生于巴黎。</P>

    ②阿瑟（Arthur），美国第二十一届总统，生于一八三○年。</P>

    ③《欧辛集》（Ossian），一部古诗集的名称，苏格兰文人麦克弗森（Macpherson）的英译本发表于一七六○年，一说该诗集系麦克弗森仿古的创作，曾传诵一时。</P>

    那些奥斯卡尔中间有一个叫斐利克斯·多罗米埃，图卢兹人；一个叫李士多里，卡奥尔人；还有一个叫法梅依，利摩日人；最后一个是勃拉什维尔，蒙托邦人。自然每个人都有他的情妇。勃拉什维尔爱宠儿，她取了那样一个名字，是因为她到英国去过一趟；李士多里锺情于用花名作别名的大丽；法梅依奉瑟芬如天人，瑟芬是约瑟芬的简称；多罗米埃有芳汀，别号金发美人，因为她生得一头日光色的美发。</P>

    宠儿、大丽、瑟芬和芳汀是四个春风满面、香气袭人的美女，但仍带有一点女工的本色，因为她们并没有完全不理针线，虽然谈情说爱，她们脸上总还多少保存一点劳动人民的庄重气味，在她们的心里也还有一朵不因破瓜而消失的诚实之花。四个人里，有一个叫做小妹，因为她的年龄最轻，还有一个叫做大姐的。大姐有二十三岁。不瞒大家说，起头的三个人，都比金发美人芳汀有经验些，放得开些，在人生的尘嚣中阅历多些，芳汀却还正做她初次的情梦。</P>

    大丽，瑟芬，尤其是宠儿，都不可能有那种痴情。她们的情史，虽然刚开始，却已有过多次的波折，第一章里的情人叫阿多尔夫，第二章里的却变了阿尔封斯，到第三章又是古士达夫了。贫寒和爱俏是两种逼死人的动力，一个埋怨，一个逢迎。平民中的一般美貌姑娘都兼而有之，每一个都附在一边耳朵上细语不停。防范不严的心灵便俯首听命了。自己落井的原因在此，别人下石的原因也在此。而人们却总要拿那一切莹洁无瑕、高不可攀的贞操来对她们求全责备。唉！假使少妇不胜饥寒之苦呢？</P>

    宠儿到英国去过一趟，因此瑟芬和大丽都羡慕她。她很早就有个家。她的父亲是个性情粗暴、爱吹牛的老数学教师，从没正式结过婚，虽然上了年纪，却还靠替人补课度日。这位教师在年轻时，有一天，看见女仆的一件衣裳挂在炉遮上，便为了那件偶然的事，动了春心。结果，有了宠儿。她有时碰见父亲，她父亲总向她行礼。有一天早晨，一个离奇古怪的老婆子走到她家里来，对她说：“小姐，您不认识我吗？”“不认识。”“我是你的妈。”那老婆子随即打开了菜橱，吃喝以后，又把她一床褥子搬来，住下了。那位叽哩咕噜、笃信上帝的母亲从不和宠儿说话，几个钟头里能不说一个字，早餐、中餐、晚餐，她一个人吃的抵得上四个人、还要到门房里去串门子，说她女儿的坏话。</P>

    大丽委身于李士多里，也许还结识过旁人，她之所以游手好闲，是她那十只过分美丽的桃红指甲在作怪。怎能忍心让那样的指甲去做工呢？凡是愿意保全自己清白的人都不应怜惜自己的手。至于瑟芬，她之所以能征服法梅依，是因为她能用一种娇里带妖的神态对他说：“是呀，先生。”</P>

    那些青年是同学，那群姑娘是朋友。那种爱情总是有那种友谊陪衬着的。</P>

    自爱和自知是两回事。这儿有个证明，我们暂且把他们那种不正规的结合放下不谈，我们可以说宠儿、瑟芬和大丽是有自知之明的姑娘，芳汀却是自爱的姑娘。</P>

    我们可以说她自爱吗？那么，多罗米埃又怎么说呢？所罗门也许会回答说爱也是自爱之一道。我们只说芳汀的爱是初次的爱，专一的爱，真诚的爱。</P>

    她在那四人当中是唯一只许一个人对她称“你”的。</P>

    芳汀是那样一个从平民的底层（不妨这样说）孕育出来的孩子。她虽然是从黑暗社会的那种不可测的深渊中生出来的，她的风度却使人摸不着她的出处和身世。她生在滨海蒙特勒伊①。出自怎样的父母？谁知道？谁也没有见过她的父母。她叫芳汀。为什么叫芳汀呢？因为人家从来不知道她有旁的名字。她出世时，督政府②还存在。她没有姓，因为她没有家；她没有教名，因为当时教堂已不过问这些事了。她在极小时赤着脚在街上走，一个过路人这样叫了她，她就得了这个名字。她接受了这个名字，正如她在下雨时额头从天上接受了一点雨水一样。大家都叫她做小芳汀。除此以外，谁也不知道关于她的其他事。她便是这样来到人间的。十岁上，芳汀出城到附近的庄稼人家里去作工。十五岁上，她到巴黎来“碰运气”。芳汀生得美，她保持她的童贞直到最后一刻。她是一个牙齿洁白、头发浅黄的漂亮姑娘。她有黄金和珍珠做奁资，不过她的黄金在她的头上，珍珠在她的口中。 </P>

    ①滨海蒙特勒伊（MontreuilCsurCmer），法国北部加来海峡省的一县。</P>

    ②督政府（Directoire），一七九五年，革命的国民公会解散，让位于代表新兴富豪阶级的督政府，一七九九年督政府解散，政权转入以波拿巴为首的执政府。</P>

    她为生活而工作，到后来，她爱上了人，这也还是为了生活，因为心也有它的饥饿。</P>

    她爱上了多罗米埃。</P>

    对他来说，这不过是逢场作戏，而对她，却是一片真情。充塞着青年学生和青年姑娘的拉丁区曾目击那场情梦的滋长。在先贤祠的高坡一带，见过多少悲欢离合的那些长街曲巷里，芳汀逃避多罗米埃何止一次，但是躲避他却正是为了遇见他。世间有那么一种躲避，恰好象是追求。简单地说，情史开场了。</P>

    勃拉什维尔、李士多里和法梅依彼此形影不离，并以多罗米埃为首领。他有办法。</P>

    多罗米埃是往日那种老资格的学生，他有钱，他有四千法郎的年息，四千法郎的年息，在圣热纳微埃夫山①上，可以为所欲为了。多罗米埃已有三十岁了，一向寻欢作乐，不爱惜身体。他脸上已经起了皱纹，牙齿也不齐全，头也秃了顶；他自己毫不在乎，他常说：“三十岁的头顶秃，四十岁的膝头僵。”他的消化力平常，有一只眼睛常淌泪。但是他的青春去得越远，他的兴致却越高。他把谐谑代替他的牙，欢乐代替他的发，讥讽代替他的健康，那只泪汪汪的眼睛也总是笑眯眯的。他已经疲劳过度，却仍旧勇气百倍。尽管年事不高，青春先萎，他却能且战且退，整军以还，笑声脆劲，在别人看来，火力还是很足的。他写过一篇戏剧，被滑稽剧院退了回来。他随时随地写一些不相干的诗。并且，他自命不凡，怀疑一切事物，在胆怯的人的眼里他成了一条好汉。因此，尽管秃头，爱讽刺，他倒做了领袖。Iron是一个作“铁”解释的英国字。难道作“讽刺”解释的ironie是从这英文字来的吗？ </P>

    ①指拉丁区，巴黎大学所在地区。</P>

    有一天，多罗米埃把那三个人拉到一边，指手画脚地向他们说：</P>

    “芳汀，大丽，瑟芬和宠儿要求我们送她们一件古怪玩意儿已快一年了。我们也曾大模大样地答应了她们。她们直到现在还常常对我们谈到这件事，尤其是对着我。正好象那不勒斯①的那些老太婆常对圣詹纳罗喊着说‘黄面皮，快显灵！’一样，我们的美人也经常向我们说：‘多罗米埃，你那怪玩意儿几时拿出来？’同时我们的父母又常有信给我们。两面夹攻。我认为时间已经到了。我们来商量一下。” </P>

    ①那不勒斯（Naples），意大利西岸港口。圣詹纳罗（SaintJanvier）又译圣雅努亚里，是它的保护神。</P>

    说到此地，多罗米埃的声音放低了，并且鬼鬼祟祟地讲了些话，有趣到使那四张口同时发出一阵奔放、兴奋的笑声，勃拉什维尔还喊道：</P>

    “这真是妙不可言！”</P>

    他们走到一个烟雾腾腾的咖啡馆门前，钻了进去，他们会议的尾声便消失在黑暗中了。</P>

    这次密谈的结果带来了下星期日举行的那场别出心裁的郊游，四位青年邀请了那四位姑娘。</P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 3 Four and Four

    It is hard nowadays to picture to one's self what a pleasure-trip of students and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago. The suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of what may be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last half-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car; where there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speak of Fecamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The Paris of 1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.</P>

    The four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time. The vacation was beginning, and it was a warm, bright, summer day. On the preceding day, Favourite, the only one who knew how to write, had written the following to Tholomyes in the name of the four: "It is a good hour to emerge from happiness." That is why they rose at five o'clock in the morning. Then they went to Saint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed, "This must be very beautiful when there is water!" They breakfasted at the Tete-Noir, where Castaing had not yet been; they treated themselves to a game of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain; they ascended Diogenes' lantern, they gambled for macaroons at the roulette establishment of the Pont de Sevres, picked bouquets at Pateaux, bought reed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tarts everywhere, and were perfectly happy.</P>

    The young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their cage. It was a perfect delirium. From time to time they bestowed little taps on the young men. Matutinal intoxication of life! adorable years! the wings of the dragonfly quiver. Oh, whoever you may be, do you not remember? Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside the branches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you? Have you slid, laughing, down a slope all wet with rain, with a beloved woman holding your hand, and crying, "Ah, my new boots! what a state they are in!"</P>

    Let us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking in the case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as they set out, with a magisterial and maternal tone, "The slugs are crawling in the paths,--a sign of rain, children."</P>

    All four were madly pretty. A good old classic poet, then famous, a good fellow who had an Eleonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as he strolled that day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them pass about ten o'clock in the morning, and exclaimed, "There is one too many of them," as he thought of the Graces. Favourite, Blachevelle's friend, the one aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front under the great green boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, and presided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun. Zephine and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together, and completed each other, never left each other, more from an instinct of coquetry than from friendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed English poses; the first keepsakes had just made their appearance, melancholy was dawning for women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of the tender sex began to droop dolefully. Zephine and Dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls. Listolier and Fameuil, who were engaged in discussing their professors, explained to Fantine the difference that existed between M. Delvincourt and M. Blondeau.</P>

    Blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry Favourite's single-bordered, imitation India shawl of Ternaux's manufacture, on his arm on Sundays.</P>

    Tholomyes followed, dominating the group. He was very gay, but one felt the force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality; his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern of nankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated himself to everything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth. Nothing was sacred to him; he smoked.</P>

    "That Tholomyes is astounding!" said the others, with veneration. "What trousers! What energy!"</P>

    As for Fantine, she was a joy to behold. Her splendid teeth had evidently received an office from God,--laughter. She preferred to carry her little hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, in her hand rather than on her head. Her thick blond hair, which was inclined to wave, and which easily uncoiled, and which it was necessary to fasten up incessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under the willows. Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly. The corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an air of encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt. There was something indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire dress. She wore a gown of mauve barege, little reddish brown buskins, whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-worked stockings, and that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention, whose name, canezou, a corruption of the words quinze aout, pronounced after the fashion of the Canebiere, signifies fine weather, heat, and midday. The three others, less timid, as we have already said, wore low-necked dresses without disguise, which in summer, beneath flower-adorned hats, are very graceful and enticing; but by the side of these audacious outfits, blond Fantine's canezou, with its transparencies, its indiscretion, and its reticence, concealing and displaying at one and the same time, seemed an alluring godsend of decency, and the famous Court of Love, presided over by the Vicomtesse de Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, have awarded the prize for coquetry to this canezou, in the contest for the prize of modesty. The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest. This does happen.</P>

    Brilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavy lids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, a white skin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to be seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust throat of the Juno of AEgina, a strong and supple nape of the neck, shoulders modelled as though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in the middle, visible through the muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess; sculptural and exquisite--such was Fantine; and beneath these feminine adornments and these ribbons one could divine a statue, and in that statue a soul.</P>

    Fantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it. Those rare dreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront everything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse in this little working-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of the ancient sacred euphony. This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred. She was beautiful in the two ways-- style and rhythm. Style is the form of the ideal; rhythm is its movement.</P>

    We have said that Fantine was joy; she was also modesty.</P>

    To an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed from her athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and her love affair, was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty. She remained a little astonished. This chaste astonishment is the shade of difference which separates Psyche from Venus. Fantine had the long, white, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pin. Although she would have refused nothing to Tholomyes, as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see, her face in repose was supremely virginal; a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state. This sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess. Her brow, her nose, her chin, presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenance results; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming fold, a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in love with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.</P>

    Love is a fault; so be it. Fantine was innocence floating high over fault.</P>

    四十五年前的学生们和姑娘们到郊外游玩的情形，到今天①已是难以想象的了。巴黎的近郊已不是当年那模样，半个世纪以来，我们可以称为巴黎郊区生活的那种情况已完全改变了，从前有子规的地方，今天有了火车；从前有游艇的地方，今天有了汽船；从前的人谈圣克鲁②，正如今天的人谈费康③一样。一八六二年的巴黎已是一个以全法国作为近郊的城市了。 </P>

    ③费康（Fécamp），英法海峡边上的一个港口。</P>

    当时在乡间所能得到的狂欢，那四对情人都一一尽情享受了。他们开始度暑假，这是个和暖爽朗的夏日。宠儿是唯一知道写字的人，她在前一日用四个人的名义写了这样一句话给多罗米埃：“青早出门很块乐。”①因此他们早晨五点就起身了。随后，他们坐上公共马车，去圣克鲁，看了一回干瀑布，大家喊着说：“有水的时候，一定很好看！”在加斯丹还没有到过的那个黑头饭店里用了午餐，在大池边的五株林里玩了一局七连环②，登上了第欧根尼的灯笼③，到过塞夫勒桥，拿着杏仁饼去押了轮盘赌，在普托采了许多花，在讷伊买了些芦管笛，沿途吃着苹果饺，快乐无比。 </P>

    ①这句话的原文里有两个错字，以示宠儿识字不多。</P>

    ③第欧根尼的灯笼（lanternedeDiogène），当地的一游览场所。关于第欧根尼的灯笼，请参阅《悲惨世界》第三部732页及901页注。</P>

    这几个姑娘好象一群逃出笼子的秀眼鸟，喧噪谈笑，闹个不休。这是一种狂欢。她们不时和这些青年们撩撩打打。一生中少年时代的陶醉！可爱的岁月！蜻蜓的翅膀颤着！呀！无论你是谁，你总忘不了吧！你曾否穿越树丛，为跟在你后面走来的姣好的头分开枝叶呢？在雨后笑着从湿润的斜坡上滑下去，一个心爱的腻友牵着你的手，口里喊着：“呀！我崭新的鞋子！弄成什么样子了！”你曾否有过这样经历呢？</P>

    让我们立刻说出来那件有趣的意外，那阵骤雨，对那一群兴高采烈的伴侣，多少有些扫兴，虽然宠儿在出发时曾用长官和慈母式的口吻说过：“孩子们，蜗牛在小路上爬，这是下雨的兆头。”</P>

    这四位姑娘都是美到令人心花怒放的。有位名震一时的古典派老诗人，自己也据有个美人儿的男子，拉布依斯骑士先生，那天也正在圣克鲁的栗树林里徘徊，他看见她们在早晨十点左右打那儿经过，叫道“可惜多了一个”，他心里想到了三位美惠女神①。勃拉什维尔的情人宠儿，二十三岁的那位大姐，在苍翠的虬枝下带头奔跑，跳过泥沟，放恣地跨过荆棘，兴致勃发，俨如田野间的幼年女神。至于瑟芬和大丽，在这场合下她们便互相接近，互相衬托，以表示她们的得意，她们寸步不离，互相倚偎，仿效英国人的姿态；我们与其说那是出于友谊，倒不如说她俩是天生爱俏。最初的几本《妇女时装手册》当时才出版不久，妇女们渐尚工愁的神情，正如日后的男子们摹仿拜伦一样，女性的头发已开始披散了，瑟芬和大丽的头发是转筒式的。李士多里和法梅依正谈论他们的教师，向芳汀述说戴尔文古先生和勃隆多先生的不同点。 </P>

    ①指希腊神话中的三个美惠女神，优雅而美丽。</P>

    勃拉什维尔仿佛生来是专门替宠儿在星期日挽她那件德尔诺式的绒线披肩的。</P>

    多罗米埃跟在后面走，做那一伙的殿后。他也是有说有笑的，不过大家总觉得他是家长。他的嬉笑总含有专制君王的意味，他的主要服装是一条象腿式的南京布裤子，用一条铜丝带把裤脚扎在脚底，手里拿一条值两百法郎的粗藤手杖，他一向为所欲为，嘴里也就衔了一支叫做雪茄的那种怪东西。他真是目空一切，竟敢吸烟。</P>

    “这个多罗米埃真是特别，”大家都肃然起敬地那样说，“他竟穿那样的裤子！他真有魄力！”</P>

    至于芳汀，她就是欢乐。她那一嘴光彩夺目的牙齿明明从上帝那里奉了一道使命，笑的使命。一顶垂着白色长飘带的精致小草帽，她拿在手里的时候多，戴在头上的时候少。一头蓬松的黄发，偏偏喜欢飘舞，容易披散，不时需要整理，仿佛是为使垂杨下的仙女遮羞而生的。她的樱唇，喋喋不休，令人听了心醉。她嘴的两角含情脉脉地向上翘着，正如爱里柯尼的古代塑像，带着一种鼓励人放肆的神气；但是她那双迟疑的睫毛蔼然低垂在冶艳的面容上，又仿佛是在说着“行不得也哥哥”一样。她周身的装饰具有一种说不出的和谐和夺目的光彩。她穿了件玫瑰紫的毛织薄呢袍，一双闪烁的玲珑古式鞋，鞋带交叉结在两旁挑花的细质白袜上，还穿一件轻罗短衫，那种短衫，是马赛人新创的式样，名叫“加纳佐”①，这个字是“八月十五”的变音，在加纳皮尔大街上是那样读的，它的含义是“睛暖的南国”。其余那三个，我们已说过，比较放纵，都干脆露着胸部，那种装束，一到夏天，在花枝招展的帽子下显得格外妖娆恼人，但是在那种大胆的装饰之外，还有金发美人芳汀的那件薄如蝉翼的“八月十五”，若隐若现，亦盖亦彰，仿佛是一种独出心裁、惹人寻味的艳服。海绿眼睛的塞特子爵夫人所主持的那个有名的情宫，也许会把服装奖颁给这件追求娴静趣味的“八月十五”。最天真的人有时是最高明的。这是常有的事。光艳的脸儿，秀丽的侧影，眼睛深蓝，眼皮如凝脂，脚秀而翘，腕、踝都肥瘦适度，美妙天成，白皙的皮肤四处露着蔚蓝的脉络，两颊鲜润得和童女一样，颈脖肥硕如埃伊纳岛②的朱诺③，后颈窝显得既健壮又柔和，两肩仿佛是库斯图④塑造的，中间有一个动人的圆涡从轻罗下透出来，多愁工媚，冷若冰霜，状如石刻，色态如蝉娟，这样便是芳汀。在那朴素的衣服下面，我们可以想见一座塑像，塑像的心中有个灵魂。 </P>

    ①“加纳佐”原文是canezou，和法文“八月十五”（quinzeaout）发音相近。</P>

    ②埃伊纳岛（Egine），希腊的一个岛。一八一一年掘出大批塑像。</P>

    ③朱诺（Junon），众神之后。</P>

    ④库斯图（Coustou），法国十八世纪的著名雕塑家。</P>

    芳汀很美，但她自己不大知道。偶然有些深思的人默默地用十全十美的标准来衡量一切事物，他们在这个小小女工的巴黎式的丰采中，也许会想见古代圣乐的和谐吧。这位出自幽谷的姑娘有根基，她在两个方面，风韵和容止方面都是美丽的。风韵是理想中的形象，容止是理想中的动静。</P>

    我们已经说过，芳汀就是欢乐，芳汀也就是贞操。一个旁观者，如果仔细研究她，就会知道，她在那种年龄、那种季节、那种爱慕的陶醉中表露出来的，只是一种谦虚谨慎、毫不苟且的神情。芳汀自己也有一些感到惊奇。这种纯洁的惊奇，也就是普赛克和维纳斯①之间的最细微的不同处。芳汀的手指，长而白，宛如拿着金针拨圣火灰的贞女。虽然她对多罗米埃的一切要求都不拒绝（关于这一点，我们以后还可以看得更清楚），但她的面貌，在静止时却仍是端庄如处子的，有时，她会突然表现出一种冷峻到近乎严肃的凛然不可犯的神情；我们看到她的欢乐忽然消失了，不需要经过一个中间阶段而立即继以沉思，世间再没有比这更奇特动人的情景了。这种突如其来的庄重，有时甚至显得严厉，正象女神的鄙夷神情。她的额、鼻和下颏具有线条上的平衡（绝不是比例上的平衡），因而构成了她面部的匀称，在从鼻底到上唇的那一段非常特别的地方，她有一种隐约难辨的美妙窝痕，那正是贞静的神秘标志，从前红胡子②之所以爱上在搜寻圣像时发现的一幅狄安娜③，也正是为了这样一种贞静之美。</P>

    好吧，爱是一种过失。芳汀却是飘浮在过失上的天贞。 </P>

    ①普赛克（Psyché），希腊神话中的一个美女，爱神的情人。维纳斯（Vénus），美神。</P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 4 Tholomyes is so Merry that he sings a Spanish Ditty

    That day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other. All nature seemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing. The flower-beds of Saint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled the leaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees pillaged the jasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow, the clover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of the King of France there was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.</P>

    The four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers, the trees, were resplendent.</P>

    And in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, dancing, chasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink, open-work stockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, all received, to some extent, the kisses of all, with the exception of Fantine, who was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed of dreaminess and wildness, and who was in love. "You always have a queer look about you," said Favourite to her.</P>

    Such things are joys. These passages of happy couples are a profound appeal to life and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth from everything. There was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in love,--in that eternal hedge-school of lovers, which is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long as there are hedges and scholars. Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers. The patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer, the limb of the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used to say in olden times, all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh and hunt, and there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis--what a transfiguration effected by love! Notaries' clerks are gods. And the little cries, the pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, those jargons which are melodies, those adorations which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable, those cherries torn from one mouth by another,--all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial glories. Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly. They think that this will never come to an end. Philosophers, poets, painters, observe these ecstasies and know not what to make of it, so greatly are they dazzled by it. The departure for Cythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painter of plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois, who have flitted away into the azure sky; Diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls, and d'Urfe mingles druids with them.</P>

    After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the King's Square to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose name escapes our memory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, was attracting all Paris to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem, whose numerous branches, bristling and leafless and as fine as threads, were covered with a million tiny white rosettes; this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowers. There was always an admiring crowd about it.</P>

    After viewing the shrub, Tholomyes exclaimed, "I offer you asses!" and having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returned by way of Vanvres and Issy. At Issy an incident occurred. The truly national park, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happened to be wide open. They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchorite in his grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus. They had stoutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the Abbe de Bernis. As he swung these beauties, one after the other, producing folds in the fluttering skirts which Greuze would have found to his taste, amid peals of laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyes, who was somewhat of a Spaniard, Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, the old ballad gallega, probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon a rope between two trees:--</P>

    "Soy de Badajoz,   "Badajoz is my home,</P>

    Amor me llama,     And Love is my name;</P>

    Toda mi alma,      To my eyes in flame,</P>

    Es en mi ojos,     All my soul doth come;</P>

    Porque ensenas,    For instruction meet</P>

    A tuas piernas.    I receive at thy feet"</P>

    Fantine alone refused to swing.</P>

    "I don't like to have people put on airs like that," muttered Favourite, with a good deal of acrimony.</P>

    After leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed the Seine in a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached the barrier of l'Etoile. They had been up since five o'clock that morning, as the reader will remember; but bah! there is no such thing as fatigue on Sunday, said Favourite; on Sunday fatigue does not work.</P>

    About three o'clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness, were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible above the trees of the Champs Elysees.</P>

    From time to time Favourite exclaimed:--</P>

    "And the surprise? I claim the surprise."</P>

    "Patience," replied Tholomyes.</P>

    那天从早到晚都充满了一股朝气。整个自然界仿佛在过节日，在嬉笑。圣克鲁的花坛吐着阵阵香气，塞纳河里的微风拂着翠叶，枝头迎风舞弄，蜂群侵占茉莉花，一群群流浪的蝴蝶在蓍草、苜蓿和野麦中间翩翩狂舞，法兰西国王的森严园囿里有成堆的流氓小鸟。</P>

    四对喜洋洋的情侣，嬉游在日光、田野、花丛、树林中，显得光艳照人。</P>

    这群来自天上的神仙谈着，唱着，互相追逐，舞蹈，扑着蝴蝶，采着牵牛，在深草中渍湿他们的粉红挑花袜；她们是鲜艳的，疯狂的，对人毫无恶念，每个姑娘都随时随地接受各个男子的吻，惟有芳汀，固守在她那种多愁易怒、半迎半拒的抵抗里，她的心有所专爱。“你，”宠儿对她说，“你老是这样。”</P>

    这就是欢乐。这一对对情侣的活动是对人生和自然发出的一种强烈的呼声，使天地万物都放出了爱和光。从前有一个仙女特地为痴情男女创造了草地和树林。从此有情人便永远逃学野游，朝朝暮暮，了无尽期，只要一天有原野和学生，这样的事便一天不会停止。因此思想家无不怀念春光。王孙公子、磨刀匠、公卿、缙绅、朝廷中人和城市中人（从前有这种说法）都成了那仙女的顺民。大家欢笑，相互追求，空中也有着一种喜悦的光彩，爱真是普天同庆！月下老人便是上帝。娇喘的叫声，草丛中的追逐，顺手搂住的细腰，音乐般的俏骂，用一个音节表现出的热爱，从这张嘴里夺到那张嘴里的樱桃，凡此种种，都烈火似的燃烧着，火焰直薄云霄。美丽的姑娘们甘于牺牲色相，那大概是永无尽期的了。哲学家、诗人和画家望着那种痴情，都不知道如何是好，他们早已眼花缭乱了。华托①号召到爱乡去。平民画家朗克雷②凝视着他那些飞入天空的仕女，狄德罗③赞颂爱情，杜尔菲④甚至说古代的祭司们也不免触景生情。 </P>

    ①华托（Watteau，1684-1721），法国画家。</P>

    ②朗克雷（Lancret，1690-1743），法国画家。</P>

    ③狄德罗（Diderot），十八世纪法国唯物主义哲学家，百科全书创编人。</P>

    ④杜尔非（dAUrfé，1567-1625），法国小说家。</P>

    午餐过后，那四对情侣到了所谓王家方城，在那里看了那株新从印度运来的植物（我一时忘了它的名称，它曾经轰动一时，把巴黎的人全吸引到了圣克鲁），它是一株新奇、悦目、枝长的小树，无数的细如线缕的旁枝蓬松披散，没有叶子，开着盈千累万的小小白团花，象一丛插满花朵的头发。成群结队的人不断地去赞赏它。</P>

    看完了树，多罗米埃大声说：“我请你们骑毛驴！”和赶驴人讲好价钱以后，他们便从凡沃尔和伊西转回来。到了伊西，又有一件意外的收获，当时由军需官布尔甘占用的那个国有公园园门恰巧大开。他们穿过铁栏门，到岩洞里望了那个木头人似的隐修僧，在那著名的明镜厅里他们又尝试了那些神秘的小玩意，那是一种诲淫的陷阱，如果是一个成为巨富的登徒子或变作普利阿普斯①的杜卡莱②，这玩意倒十分相称。在伯尔尼神甫祭过的那两株栗树间，系着一个大秋千网，他们使劲荡了一回。那些美人一个个轮流荡着，裙边飞扬，皆大欢喜，戈洛治③如在场，大约又找到他的题材了；正在那时，那位图卢兹人多罗米埃（他和西班牙人的性格有些渊源，图卢兹和托洛萨是妹妹城）用一种情致缠绵的曲调，唱了一首旧时的西班牙歌曲，大致是因为看见一个美丽的姑娘在树间的绳索上荡来荡去而有所感吧：</P>

    我来自巴达霍斯，</P>

    受了情魔的驱使，</P>

    我全部的灵魂</P>

    都在我的眼里。</P>

    为什么</P>

    要露出你的腿。 </P>

    ①普利阿普斯（Priape），园艺、畜牧、生育之神。</P>

    ②杜卡莱（Turcaret），十八世纪初法国喜剧家勒萨日（Lesage）所作喜剧中</P>

    ③戈洛治（Greuze，1725-1805），法国画家。</P>

    只有芳汀一个人不肯打秋千。</P>

    “我不喜欢有人装这种腔。”宠儿气愤愤地说。丢了毛驴，又有了新的欢乐，他们坐上船，渡过塞纳河，从巴喜走到明星区便门。我们记得，他们是在早晨五点起身的，但是，没有关系！“星期日没有什么叫做疲倦，”宠儿说，“疲倦到星期日也去休息了。”三点左右，这四对乐不可支的朋友，跑上了俄罗斯山①，那是当时在波戎高地上的一种新奇建筑物，我们从爱丽舍广场的树梢上望过去，便可以望见它那婉蜒曲折的线路。 </P>

    ①俄罗斯山，一种供人游戏的蜿蜒起伏的架空铁道。</P>

    宠儿不时喊道：</P>

    “还有那新鲜玩意呢？我要那新鲜玩意儿。”</P>

    “不用急。”多罗米埃回答。</P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 5 At Bombardas

    The Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think about dinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, became stranded in Bombarda's public house, a branch establishment which had been set up in the Champs-Elysees by that famous restaurant-keeper, Bombarda, whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, near Delorme Alley.</P>

    A large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sunday crowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quay and the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching the panes; two tables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets, mingled with the hats of men and women; at the other the four couples seated round a merry confusion of platters, dishes, glasses, and bottles; jugs of beer mingled with flasks of wine; very little order on the table, some disorder beneath it;</P>

    "They made beneath the table</P>

    A noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable," says Moliere.</P>

    This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o'clock in the morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. The sun was setting; their appetites were satisfied.</P>

    The Champs-Elysees, filled with sunshine and with people, were nothing but light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed. The horses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud of gold. Carriages were going and coming. A squadron of magnificent body-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending the Avenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting sun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde, which had become the Place Louis XV. once more, was choked with happy promenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from button-holes in the year 1817. Here and there choruses of little girls threw to the winds, amid the passersby, who formed into circles and applauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined to strike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its refrain:--</P>

    "Rendez-nous notre pere de Gand, Rendez-nous notre pere."</P>

    "Give us back our father from Ghent, Give us back our father."</P>

    Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes even decorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over the large square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and revolving on the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some journeyman printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. Every thing was radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security; it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief of Police Angeles to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris, terminated with these lines:--</P>

    "Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be feared from these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats. The populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are very pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of this population should have diminished in the last fifty years; and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the Revolution. It is not dangerous. In short, it is an amiable rabble."</P>

    Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform itself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised by Count Angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their eyes it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the Piraeus, there stood on the public square in Corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of the Restoration beheld the populace of Paris in too "rose-colored" a light; it is not so much of "an amiable rabble" as it is thought. The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one sleeps more soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be trusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when there is glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury. Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, you will have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon's stay and Danton's resource. Is it a question of country, he enlists; is it a question of liberty, he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath, is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take care! He will make of the first Rue Grenetat which comes to hand Caudine Forks. When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature; this little man will arise, and his gaze will be terrible, and his breath will become a tempest, and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps. It is, thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, mixed with arms, conquers Europe. He sings; it is his delight. Proportion his song to his nature, and you will see! As long as he has for refrain nothing but la Carmagnole, he only overthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing the Marseillaise, and he will free the world.</P>

    This note jotted down on the margin of Angles' report, we will return to our four couples. The dinner, as we have said, was drawing to its close.</P>

    俄罗斯山溜完以后，他们想到了晚餐，到底有些疲倦了，兴高采烈的八仙在蓬巴达酒家歇下来了，那酒家是有名的饭店老板蓬巴达在爱丽舍广场设下的分店，当时人们可以从里沃利街，德乐麦通道旁边看见它的招牌。</P>

    一间房间，宽敞而丑陋，里面有壁厢，厢底有床（由于星期日酒楼人满，只得忍受那样的地方）；两扇窗子，凭窗可以眺望榆树外面的河水和河岸，一股八月的明媚阳光正射在窗口；两张桌子，一张上面有着堆积如山的鲜花以及男人和女人的帽子，另一张，则由这四对朋友占了，他们团团坐在一堆喜气洋洋的杯盘瓶碟的周围，啤酒罐和葡萄酒瓶杂陈，桌上不大有秩序，桌下更是有点乱。</P>

    “他们用脚在桌子下面搞得乒零乓郎一团糟。”莫里哀说过。</P>

    这就是从早晨五点开始的那次郊游到了下午四点半钟时的情形。太阳西沉了，意兴也阑珊了。</P>

    充满了日光和人群的爱丽舍广场只见阳光和灰尘，那是构成光辉的两种东西。马尔利雕刻的一群石马，在金粉似的烟尘中立在后蹄上，引颈长鸣。华丽的马车川流不息。一队堂皇富丽的近卫骑兵，随着喇叭，从讷伊林荫大道走下来，一面白旗①在斜阳返照中带着淡红颜色，在杜伊勒里宫的圆顶上飘荡。协和广场（当时已经恢复旧名，叫路易十五广场）上人山人海，个个喜气洋洋。许多人的衣纽上还佩着一朵吊在一条白闪缎带上的银百合花，那种东西，到一八一七年还没有完全绝迹。这儿那儿，成群的小女孩，在过路闲人围观鼓掌声中跳着团圆舞，迎风唱着一种波旁舞曲，那种舞曲，本是用来打倒百日帝政的，直到当时还流行，其中的叠句是：</P>

    送还我们根特②的伯伯，</P>

    送还我们的伯伯。 </P>

    ①波旁王朝的旗帜。</P>

    ②根特（Gand），比利时城市，百日帝政期间，路易十八逃亡在那里。</P>

    一群群近郊居民，穿着节日的漂亮衣服，有些还模仿绅士，也佩上一朵百合花，四散在大方场和马里尼方场上，玩着七连环游戏或是骑着木马兜圆圈，其余一些人喝着酒；印刷厂里的几个学徒，戴着纸帽，又说又笑。处处都光辉灿烂。无可否认，那确是国泰民安，君权巩固的时代。警署署长昂格勒斯曾向国王递过一本私人密奏，谈到巴黎四郊的情形，他最后的几句话是这样的：“陛下，根据各方面的缜密观察，这些人民不足为畏。他们都和猫儿一样，懒惰驯良。外省的下民好骚动，巴黎的人民却不然。这全是些小民，陛下，要两个这样的小民叠起来，才抵得上一个近卫军士。在首都的民众方面，完全没有可虑的地方。五十年来，人民的身材又缩小了，这是值得注意的，巴黎四郊的人民，比革命前更矮小了。他们不足为害。总而言之，这都是些贱民，驯良的贱民。”</P>

    警署署长们是绝不相信猫能变成狮子的，然而事实上却是可能的，而且那正是巴黎人民的奇迹。就拿猫来说吧，昂格勒斯那样瞧不起猫，猫却受到古代共和国的尊重，他们认为猫是自由的化身，在科林斯①城的公共广场上，就有一只极大的紫铜猫，仿佛是和比雷埃夫斯②的那尊无翅膀的密涅瓦塑像作对衬似的。复辟时代的警察太天真，把巴黎的人民看得太“易与”了。恰恰相反，他们绝不是“驯良的贱民”，巴黎人之于法兰西人，正如雅典人之于希腊人，他比任何人都睡得好些，他比任何人都着实要来得轻佻懒惰些，没有人比他更显得健忘，但是切不可以为他们是可靠的，他尽可以百般疏懒，但是一旦光荣在望，他便会奋不顾身，什么都干的。给他一支矛吧，他可以干出八月十日③的事，给他一支枪吧，他可以再有一次奥斯特里茨。他是拿破仑的支柱，丹东④的后盾。国家发生了问题？他捐躯行伍；自由发生了问题？他喋血街头；留神！他的怒发令人难忘；他的布衫可以和希腊的宽袍媲美，他会象在格尔内塔街那样，迫使强敌投降。当心！时机一到，这个郊区的居民就会长大起来的。这小子会站起来，怒目向人，他吐出的气将变成飓风，从他孱弱的胸中，会呼出足够的风，来改变阿尔卑斯山的丘壑。革命之所以能够战胜欧洲，全赖军队里巴黎郊区的居民。他歌唱，那是他的欢乐。你让他的歌适合他的性格，你看着吧！如果他唱来唱去只有《卡玛尼奥拉》⑤一首歌，他当然只能推倒路易十六；但你如果叫他唱《马赛曲》，他便能拯救全世界。 </P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 6 A Chapter in which they adore Each Other

    Chat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce one as the other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table is smoke.</P>

    Fameuil and Dahlia were humming. Tholomyes was drinking. Zephine was laughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at Saint-Cloud.</P>

    Favourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:--</P>

    "Blachevelle, I adore you."</P>

    This called forth a question from Blachevelle:--</P>

    "What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?"</P>

    "I!" cried Favourite. "Ah! Do not say that even in jest! If you were to cease to love me, I would spring after you, I would scratch you, I should rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have you arrested."</P>

    Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is tickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:--</P>

    "Yes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should not restrain myself, not at all! Rabble!"</P>

    Blachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, and closed both eyes proudly.</P>

    Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:--</P>

    "So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?"</P>

    "I? I detest him," replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork again. "He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my house. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? One can see that he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comes in, his mother says to him: `Ah! mon Dieu! My peace of mind is gone. There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting my head!' So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know what? so that he can be heard down stairs! He earns twenty sous a day at an attorney's by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so, that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said to me: `Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.' It is only artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very nice. I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow. Never mind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him--how I lie! Hey! How I do lie!"</P>

    Favourite paused, and then went on:--</P>

    "I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing but rain all summer; the wind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very stingy; there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not know what to eat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so dear! and then you see it is horrible, here we are dining in a room with a bed in it, and that disgusts me with life."</P>

    餐桌上的谈话和情侣们的谈话同样是不可捉摸的，情侣们的谈话是云霞，餐桌上的谈话是烟雾。</P>

    法梅依和大丽哼着歌儿，多罗米埃喝着酒，瑟芬笑着，芳汀微笑着。李士多里吹着在圣克鲁买来的木喇叭。宠儿脉脉含情地望着勃拉什维尔说道：</P>

    “勃拉什维尔。我爱你。”</P>

    这话引起了勃拉什维尔的一个问题。</P>

    “宠儿，假使我不爱你了，你将怎样呢？”</P>

    “我吗！”宠儿喊着说，“唉！不要说这种话，哪怕是开玩笑，也不要说这种话！假使你不爱我了，我就跳到你后面，抓你的皮，扯你的头发，把水淋到你的身上，叫你吃官司。”</P>

    勃拉什维尔自诩多情地微笑了一下，正如一个自尊心获得极端满足而感到舒服的人一样。宠儿又说：</P>

    “是呀！我会叫警察！哼！你以为我有什么事做不出的！</P>

    坏种！”</P>

    勃拉什维尔，受宠若惊，仰在椅上，沾沾自喜地闭上了眼睛。</P>

    大丽吃个不停，从喧杂的语声中对宠儿说：</P>

    “看来，你对你的勃拉什维尔不是很痴心吗？”</P>

    “我，我厌恶他，”宠儿用了同样的语调回答，重又拿起她的叉子。“他舍不得花钱。我爱着在我对面住的那个小伙子。那小子长得漂亮得很，你认得他吗？他很有做戏子的派头。我喜欢戏子。他一回家，他娘就说：‘呀！我的上帝！我又不得安静了。他要叫起来了。唉，我的朋友，你要叫破我的脑袋吗！’因为他一到家里，便到那些住耗子的阁楼上，那些黑洞里，越高越好，他在那里又唱又朗诵，谁知道他搞些什么！下面的人都听得见。他在一个律师家里写讼词，每天已能赚二十个苏了。他父亲是圣雅克教堂里的唱诗人。呀！他生得非常好。他已经爱我到这种地步，有一天，他看见我在调灰面做薄饼，他对我说：‘小姐，您拿您的手套做些饼，我全会吃下去。’世界上只有艺术家才会说这样的话。听！他生得非常好。我已要为那小白脸发疯了。这不打紧，我对勃拉什维尔还是说我爱他。</P>

    我多么会撒谎！你说是吗？我多么会撒谎！”</P>

    宠儿喘了口气，又继续说：</P>

    “大丽，你知道吗？我心里烦得很。落了一夏季的雨，这风真叫我受不了，风又熄不了我心头的火，勃拉什维尔是个小气鬼，菜场里又不大有豌豆卖，他只知道吃，正好象英国人说的，我害‘忧郁病’了，奶油又那么贵！并且，你瞧，真是笑话，我们竟会在有床铺的房间里吃饭，我还不如死了的好。”</P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 7 The Wisdom of Tholomyes

    In the meantime, while some sang, the rest talked together tumultuously all at once; it was no longer anything but noise. Tholomyes intervened.</P>

    "Let us not talk at random nor too fast," he exclaimed. "Let us reflect, if we wish to be brilliant. Too much improvisation empties the mind in a stupid way. Running beer gathers no froth. No haste, gentlemen. Let us mingle majesty with the feast. Let us eat with meditation; let us make haste slowly. Let us not hurry. Consider the springtime; if it makes haste, it is done for; that is to say, it gets frozen. Excess of zeal ruins peach-trees and apricot-trees. Excess of zeal kills the grace and the mirth of good dinners. No zeal, gentlemen! Grimod de la Reyniere agrees with Talleyrand."</P>

    A hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group.</P>

    "Leave us in peace, Tholomyes," said Blachevelle.</P>

    "Down with the tyrant!" said Fameuil.</P>

    "Bombarda, Bombance, and Bambochel!" cried Listolier.</P>

    "Sunday exists," resumed Fameuil.</P>

    "We are sober," added Listolier.</P>

    "Tholomyes," remarked Blachevelle, "contemplate my calmness [mon calme]."</P>

    "You are the Marquis of that," retorted Tholomyes.</P>

    This mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool. The Marquis de Montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist. All the frogs held their peace.</P>

    "Friends," cried Tholomyes, with the accent of a man who had recovered his empire, "Come to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from the skies must not be received with too much stupor. Everything which falls in that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The pun is the dung of the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter where; and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure depths. A whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the condor from soaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honor it in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most august, the most sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps outside of humanity, have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses on Isaac, AEschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And observe that Cleopatra's pun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not been for it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name which signifies a ladle. That once conceded, I return to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays on words. Listen to me. I have the prudence of Amphiaraus and the baldness of Caesar. There must be a limit, even to rebuses. Est modus in rebus.</P>

    "There must be a limit, even to dinners. You are fond of apple turnovers, ladies; do not indulge in them to excess. Even in the matter of turnovers, good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the glutton, Gula punit Gulax. Indigestion is charged by the good God with preaching morality to stomachs. And remember this: each one of our passions, even love, has a stomach which must not be filled too full. In all things the word finis must be written in good season; self-control must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawn on appetite; one must set one's own fantasy to the violin, and carry one's self to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a given moment, to effect his own arrest. Have some confidence in me, for I have succeeded to some extent in my study of the law, according to the verdict of my examinations, for I know the difference between the question put and the question pending, for I have sustained a thesis in Latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at Rome at the epoch when Munatius Demens was quaestor of the Parricide; because I am going to be a doctor, apparently it does not follow that it is absolutely necessary that I should be an imbecile. I recommend you to moderation in your desires. It is true that my name is Felix Tholomyes; I speak well. Happy is he who, when the hour strikes, takes a heroic resolve, and abdicates like Sylla or Origenes."</P>

    Favourite listened with profound attention.</P>

    "Felix," said she, "what a pretty word! I love that name. It is Latin; it means prosper."</P>

    Tholomyes went on:--</P>

    "Quirites, gentlemen, caballeros, my friends. Do you wish never to feel the prick, to do without the nuptial bed, and to brave love? Nothing more simple. Here is the receipt: lemonade, excessive exercise, hard labor; work yourself to death, drag blocks, sleep not, hold vigil, gorge yourself with nitrous beverages, and potions of nymphaeas; drink emulsions of poppies and agnus castus; season this with a strict diet, starve yourself, and add thereto cold baths, girdles of herbs, the application of a plate of lead, lotions made with the subacetate of lead, and fomentations of oxycrat."</P>

    "I prefer a woman," said Listolier.</P>

    "Woman," resumed Tholomyes; "distrust her. Woe to him who yields himself to the unstable heart of woman! Woman is perfidious and disingenuous. She detests the serpent from professional jealousy. The serpent is the shop over the way."</P>

    "Tholomyes!" cried Blachevelle, "you are drunk!"</P>

    "Pardieu," said Tholomyes.</P>

    "Then be gay," resumed Blachevelle.</P>

    "I agree to that," responded Tholomyes.</P>

    And, refilling his glass, he rose.</P>

    "Glory to wine! Nunc te, Bacche, canam! Pardon me ladies; that is Spanish. And the proof of it, senoras, is this: like people, like cask. The arrobe of Castile contains sixteen litres; the cantaro of Alicante, twelve; the almude of the Canaries, twenty-five; the cuartin of the Balearic Isles, twenty-six; the boot of Tzar Peter, thirty. Long live that Tzar who was great, and long live his boot, which was still greater! Ladies, take the advice of a friend; make a mistake in your neighbor if you see fit. The property of love is to err. A love affair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an English serving-maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is not made for that; it errs gayly, our gentle love. It has been said, error is human; I say, error is love. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Zephine, O Josephine, face more than irregular, you would be charming were you not all askew. You have the air of a pretty face upon which some one has sat down by mistake. As for Favourite, O nymphs and muses! one day when Blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Guerin-Boisseau, he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, which displayed her legs. This prologue pleased him, and Blachevelle fell in love. The one he loved was Favourite. O Favourite, thou hast Ionian lips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who was surnamed the painter of the lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paint thy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was never a creature worthy of the name. Thou wert made to receive the apple like Venus, or to eat it like Eve; beauty begins with thee. I have just referred to Eve; it is thou who hast created her. Thou deservest the letters-patent of the beautiful woman. O Favourite, I cease to address you as `thou,' because I pass from poetry to prose. You were speaking of my name a little while ago. That touched me; but let us, whoever we may be, distrust names. They may delude us. I am called Felix, and I am not happy. Words are liars. Let us not blindly accept the indications which they afford us. It would be a mistake to write to Liege[2] for corks, and to Pau for gloves. Miss Dahlia, were I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. A flower should smell sweet, and woman should have wit. I say nothing of Fantine; she is a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; she is a phantom possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun, who has strayed into the life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in illusions, and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well knowing what she sees or what she is doing, and who, with her eyes fixed on heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in existence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomyes, I am all illusion; but she does not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras! as for the rest, everything about her is freshness, suavity, youth, sweet morning light. O Fantine, maid worthy of being called Marguerite or Pearl, you are a woman from the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a second piece of advice: do not marry; marriage is a graft; it takes well or ill; avoid that risk. But bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words. Girls are incurable on the subject of marriage, and all that we wise men can say will not prevent the waistcoat-makers and the shoe-stitchers from dreaming of husbands studded with diamonds. Well, so be it; but, my beauties, remember this, you eat too much sugar. You have but one fault, O woman, and that is nibbling sugar. O nibbling sex, your pretty little white teeth adore sugar. Now, heed me well, sugar is a salt. All salts are withering. Sugar is the most desiccating of all salts; it sucks the liquids of the blood through the veins; hence the coagulation, and then the solidification of the blood; hence tubercles in the lungs, hence death. That is why diabetes borders on consumption. Then, do not crunch sugar, and you will live. I turn to the men: gentlemen, make conquest, rob each other of your well-beloved without remorse. Chassez across. In love there are no friends. Everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open. No quarter, war to the death! a pretty woman is a casus belli; a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor. All the invasions of history have been determined by petticoats. Woman is man's right. Romulus carried off the Sabines; William carried off the Saxon women; Caesar carried off the Roman women. The man who is not loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses of other men; and for my own part, to all those unfortunate men who are widowers, I throw the sublime proclamation of Bonaparte to the army of Italy: "Soldiers, you are in need of everything; the enemy has it."</P>

    [2] Liege: a cork-tree. Pau: a jest on peau, skin.</P>

    Tholomyes paused.</P>

    "Take breath, Tholomyes," said Blachevelle.</P>

    At the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier and Fameuil, struck up to a plaintive air, one of those studio songs composed of the first words which come to hand, rhymed richly and not at all, as destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind, which have their birth in the vapor of pipes, and are dissipated and take their flight with them. This is the couplet by which the group replied to Tholomyes' harangue:--</P>

    "The father turkey-cocks so grave Some money to an agent gave, That master good Clermont-Tonnerre Might be made pope on Saint Johns' day fair. But this good Clermont could not be Made pope, because no priest was he; And then their agent, whose wrath burned, With all their money back returned."</P>

    This was not calculated to calm Tholomyes' improvisation; he emptied his glass, filled, refilled it, and began again:--</P>

    "Down with wisdom! Forget all that I have said. Let us be neither prudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes. I propose a toast to mirth; be merry. Let us complete our course of law by folly and eating! Indigestion and the digest. Let Justinian be the male, and Feasting, the female! Joy in the depths! Live, O creation! The world is a great diamond. I am happy. The birds are astonishing. What a festival everywhere! The nightingale is a gratuitous Elleviou. Summer, I salute thee! O Luxembourg! O Georgics of the Rue Madame, and of the Allee de l'Observatoire! O pensive infantry soldiers! O all those charming nurses who, while they guard the children, amuse themselves! The pampas of America would please me if I had not the arcades of the Odeon. My soul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas. All is beautiful. The flies buzz in the sun. The sun has sneezed out the humming bird. Embrace me, Fantine!"</P>

    He made a mistake and embraced Favourite.</P>

    这时，有几个人唱着歌，其余的人都谈着话，稀里哗啦，也不分个先后，到处只有一片乱嘈嘈的声音。多罗米埃开口了：“我们不应当胡说八道，也不应当说得太快，”他大声说，“让我们想想，我们是不是想要卖弄自己的口才。过分地信口开河只能浪费精力，再傻也没有了。流着的啤酒堆不起泡沫。先生们，不可性急。我们吃喝，也得有吃喝的气派。让我们细心地吃，慢慢地喝。我们不必赶快。你们看春天吧，如果它来得太快，它就烧起来了，就是说，一切植物都不能发芽了。过分的热可以损害桃花和杏花。过分的热也可以消灭盛宴的雅兴和欢乐。先生们，心不可热！拉雷尼埃尔①和塔列朗的意见都是这样。”</P>

    一阵震耳欲聋的反抗声从那堆人里发出来。</P>

    “多罗米埃，不要闹！”勃拉什维尔说。</P>

    ‘打倒专制魔王！”法梅依说。</P>

    “蓬巴达②！蓬彭斯③！彭博什④！”</P>

    “星期日还没完呢。”法梅依又说。</P>

    “我们并没有乱来。”李士多里说。</P>

    “多罗米埃，”勃拉什维尔说，“请注意我的安静态度。”</P>

    “在这方面，你算得是侯爷。”</P>

    这句小小的隐语竟好象是一块丢在池塘里的石头。安静山⑤侯爵是当时一个大名鼎鼎的保王党。蛙群全没声息了。 </P>

    ①拉雷尼埃尔（GrimoddelaReynière），巴黎的烹调专家，著有食谱。</P>

    ②蓬巴达（Bombarda），酒家。</P>

    ③蓬彭斯（Bombance），盛筵。</P>

    ④彭博什（Bambocbhe），荷兰画家。</P>

    ⑤“安静山”（Montcalm）和上面勃拉什维尔所说的“我的安静”（moncalme）同音。</P>

    “朋友们，”多罗米埃以一个重获首领地位的人的口吻大声说，“安静下来。见了这种天上落下来的玩笑也不必太慌张。凡是这样落下来的东西，不一定是值得兴奋和敬佩的。隐语是飞着的精灵所遗的粪。笑话四处都有，精灵在说笑一通之后，又飞上天去了。神鹰遗了一堆白色的秽物在岩石上，仍旧翱翔自如。我毫不亵渎隐语。我仅就它价值的高下，寄以相当的敬意罢了。人类中，也许是人类以外，最尊严、最卓越和最可亲的人都说过隐语。耶稣基督说过一句有关圣彼得的隐语。摩西在谈到以撒、埃斯库罗斯、波吕尼刻斯时，克娄巴特拉在谈到屋大维时也都使用过隐语。还要请你们注意，克娄巴特拉的隐语是在亚克兴①战争以前说的，假使没有它，也就不会有人记得多临城，多临在希腊语中只是一个勺而已。这件事交代以后，我再回头来说我的劝告词。我的弟兄们，我再说一遍，即使是在说俏皮话、诙谐、笑谑和隐语时，也不可过于热心，不可嚣张，不可过分。诸位听我讲，我有安菲阿拉俄斯②的谨慎和恺撒的秃顶。即使是猜谜语，也应当有限度。这就是拉丁话所谓的Estmodusinrebus。即使是饮食，也应当有节制。 </P>

    ①亚克兴（Actium），公元前三一年罗马舰队在屋大维率领下，击败叛将安敦尼于此，埃及王后克娄巴特拉死之。</P>

    ②安菲阿拉俄斯（AmphiararauBs），攻打底比斯的七英雄之一，是著名的先知。</P>

    女士们，你们喜欢苹果饺，可不要吃得太多了。就是吃饺，也应当有限度和有艺术手法。贪多嚼不烂，好比蛇吞象。胃病总是由于贪吃。疳积病是上帝派来教育胃的。并且你们应当记住这一点：我们的每一种欲念，甚至包括爱情在内，也都有胃口，不可太饱。在任何事情上，都应当在适当的时候写上‘终’字；在紧急的时候，我们应当自行约束，推上食量的门闩，囚禁自己的妄念，并且自请处罚。知道在适当的时候自动管制自己的人就是聪明人。对于我，你们不妨多少有点信心，因为我学过一点法律，我的考试成绩可以证明，因为我知道存案和悬案间的差别，因为我用拉丁文做过一篇论文，论《缪纳修斯·德门任弑君者的度支官时期的罗马刑法》，因为我快做博士了，照说，从此以后，我就一定不会是个蠢才了。我劝告你们，应当节欲。我说的是好话，真实可靠到和我叫斐利克斯·多罗米埃一样。时机一到，就下定决心，象西拉①或奥利金②那样，毅然引退，那样才真是快乐的人。”</P>

    宠儿聚精会神地听着。</P>

    “斐利克斯！”她说，“这是个多么漂亮的名字！我爱这个名字。这是拉丁文，作‘兴盛’解释。”</P>

    多罗米埃接下去说：</P>

    “公民们，先生们，少爷们③，朋友们！你们要摒绝床第之事，放弃儿女之情而毫不冲动吗？再简单也没有。这就是药方：柠檬水，过度的体操，强迫劳动，疲劳，拖重东西，不睡觉，守夜，多饮含硝质的饮料和白荷花汤，尝莺粟油和马鞭草油，厉行节食，饿肚子，继之以冷水浴，使用草索束身，佩带铅块，用醋酸铅擦身，用醋汤作热敷。” </P>

    ①西拉（Sylla），即苏拉（Sulla），公元前一世纪罗马的独裁者。</P>

    ②奥利金（Origène，约前185-254），基督教神学家。</P>

    ③这三种称呼，原文用的是拉丁文、英文和西班牙文：guirites，gentlemen，caballeros。</P>

    “我宁愿请教女人。”李士多里说。</P>

    “女人！”多罗米埃说，“你们得小心。女人杨花水性，信赖她们，那真是自讨苦吃。女人是邪淫寡信的。她们恨蛇，那只是出于同业的妒嫉心。蛇和女人是对门住的。”</P>

    “多罗米埃！”勃拉什维尔喊着说，“你喝醉了！”</P>

    “可不是！”多罗米埃说。</P>

    “那么，你乐一乐吧。”勃拉什维尔又说。</P>

    “我同意。”多罗米埃回答。</P>

    于是，一面斟满酒，一面立起来：</P>

    “光荣属于美酒！现在，酒神，请喝！①对不起，诸位小姐，这是西班牙文。证据呢，女士们，就是这样。怎样的民族就有怎样的酒桶。卡斯蒂利亚②的亚洛伯，盛十六公升，阿利坎特的康达罗十二公升，加那利群岛的亚尔缪德二十五公升，巴科阿里③群岛的苦亚丹二十六公升，沙皇彼得的普特三十公升。伟大的彼得万岁，他那更伟大的普特万万岁。诸位女士们，请让我以朋友资格奉劝一句话：你们应当随心所欲，广结良缘。爱情的本质就是乱撞。爱神不需要象一个膝盖上擦起疙瘩的英国女仆那样死死蹲在一个地方。那位温柔的爱神生来并不是这样的，它嘻嘻哈哈四处乱撞，别人说过，撞错总也还是人情；我说，撞错总也还是爱情。诸位女士，我崇拜你们中的每一位。呵瑟芬，呵，约瑟芬，俏皮娘儿，假使你不那样撅着嘴，你就更迷人了。你那神气好象是被谁在你脸上无意中坐了一下子似的。至于宠儿，呵，山林中的仙女和缪斯！勃拉什维尔一天走过格雷－巴梭街的小溪边，看见一个美貌姑娘，露着腿，穿着一双白袜，拉得紧紧的。这个样子合了他的意，于是勃拉什维尔着迷了。他爱的那个人儿便是宠儿。呵，宠儿！你有爱奥尼亚人的嘴唇。从前有个希腊画家叫欧风里翁，别人给了他个别号，叫嘴唇画家。只有那个希腊人才配画你的嘴唇。听我说！在你以前，没有一个人是够得上他一画的。你和美神一样是为得苹果而生的，或者说，和夏娃一样，是为吃苹果而生的。美是由你开始的。我刚才提到了夏娃，夏娃是你创造出来的。你有资格获得‘发明美女’的证书。呵，宠儿，我不再称您为你了。因为我要由诗歌转入散文了。刚才您谈到我的名字，您打动了我的心弦，但是无论我们是什么人，对于名字，总不宜轻信。名不一定副实。我叫做斐利克斯，但是我并不快乐。字是骗人的。我们不要盲目接受它的含义。写信到列日④去买软木塞，到波城⑤去买皮手套，那才荒唐呢。密斯⑥大丽，我如果是您的话，我就要叫做玫瑰，花应当有香味，女子应当有智慧。至于芳汀，我不打算说什么，她是一个多幻象、多梦想、多思虑、多感触的人，一个具有仙女的体态和信女的贞洁的小精灵；她失足在风流女郎的队伍里，又要在幻想中藏身，她唱歌，却又祈祷又望着天空，但又不大知道她所望的是什么，也不大知道她所作的究竟是什么，她望着天空，自以为生活在大花园里，以为到处是花和鸟，而实际上花和鸟并不多。呵，芳汀，您应当知道这一点：我，多罗米埃，我只是一种幻象，但是这位心思缥渺的黄发女郎，她并没有听见我说话！然而她有的全是光艳、趣味、青春、柔美的晨曦。呵，芳汀，您是一个值得称为白菊或明珠的姑娘，您是一个满身珠光宝气的妇女。诸位女士，还有第二个忠告：你们决不要嫁人，结婚犹如接木，效果好坏，不一定，你们不必自寻苦吃。但是，哎呀！我在这里胡说些什么？我失言了。姑娘们在配偶问题上是不可救药的。我们这些明眼人所能说的一切绝不足以防止那些做背心、做鞋子的姑娘们去梦想那些金玉满堂的良人。不管它，就是这样吧，但是，美人们，请记牢这一点：你们的糖，吃得太多了。呵，妇女们，你们只有一个错误：就是好嚼糖。呵，啮齿类的女性，你的皓齿多爱糖呵。那么，好好地听我讲、糖是一种盐。一切盐都吸收水分。糖在各种盐里有着最富于吸收水分的能力。它通过血管，把血液里的水分提出来，于是血液凝结，由凝结而凝固，而得肺结核，而死亡。因此，糖尿病常和痨病并发。因此，你们不要嚼糖就长寿了！现在我转到男子方面来。先生们，多多霸占妇女。在你们彼此之间不妨毫无顾忌地互相霸占爱人。猎艳，乱交，情场中无所谓朋友。凡是有一个漂亮女子的地方，争夺总是公开的；无分区域，大家杀个你死我活！一个漂亮女子便是一场战争的缘因，一个漂亮女子便是一场明目张胆的盗窃。历来一切的劫掠都是在亵衣上发动的。罗慕洛掳过萨宾妇人⑦，威廉掳过萨克森妇人，恺撒掳过罗马妇人。没有女子爱着的男子，总好象饿鹰那样，在别人的情妇头上翱翔。至于我，我向一切没有家室的可怜虫介绍波拿巴的《告意大利大军书》：‘兵士们，你们什么也没有。敌人却有。’” </P>

    同时，勃拉什维尔开始唱一支悲伤的歌，李士多里和法梅依随声和着，那种歌是用从车间里信手拈来的歌词编的，音韵似乎很丰富，其实完全没有音韵；意义空虚，有如风声树影，是从烟斗的雾气中产生出来的，因此也就和雾气一同飘散消失。</P>

    下面便是那群人答复多罗米埃的演说词的一节：</P>

    几个荒唐老头子，</P>

    拿些银子交给狗腿子，</P>

    要教克雷蒙－东纳①先生，</P>

    圣约翰节坐上教皇的位子，</P>

    克雷蒙－东纳先生不能当教皇，</P>

    原来他不是教士，</P>

    狗腿子气冲冲，</P>

    送还他们的银子。 </P>

    ①克雷蒙－东纳（ClemontCTonnerre），法国多菲内地区一大家族，其中最著名者一是红衣主教，一是伯爵。</P>

    那种歌并不能平息多罗米埃的随机应变的口才。他干了杯，再斟上一杯，又说起话来。</P>

    “打倒圣人！我说的话，你们全不必放在心上。我们不要清规戒律，不要束手束脚，不要谨小慎微。我要为欢乐浮一大白，让我们狂欢吧！让我们拿放荡和酒肉来补足我们的法律课。吃喝，消化。让查士丁尼①作雄的，让酒囊饭装作雌的。喜气弥漫穹苍呵！造物主！祝你长生！地球是一颗大金刚钻！我快乐。雀鸟真够劲，遍地都是盛会！黄莺儿是一个任人欣赏的艾勒维奥②。夏日，我向你致敬。呵，卢森堡，呵，夫人街和天文台路的竹枝词！呵，神魂颠倒的丘八！呵，那些看守孩子又拿孩子寻开心的漂亮女用人。如果我没有奥德翁③的长廊，我也许会喜欢美洲的草原吧。我的灵魂飞向森林中的处女地和广漠的平原。一切都是美的。青蝇在日光中营营飞舞。太阳打喷嚏打出了蜂雀。吻我吧，芳汀。”</P>

    他弄错了，吻了宠儿。 </P>

    ①查士丁尼（Justinien，483-565），拜占庭皇帝，编有《法家言类纂》</P>

    （digeste）书名与“消化”（digestion）近似。</P>

    ②艾勒维奥（Elleviou），当时法国的一个著名歌唱家。</P>

    ③奥德翁（Odéon），指奥德翁戏院，一七九七年成立。 </P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 8 The Death of a Horse

    "The dinners are better at Edon's than at Bombarda's," exclaimed Zephine.</P>

    "I prefer Bombarda to Edon," declared Blachevelle. "There is more luxury. It is more Asiatic. Look at the room downstairs; there are mirrors [glaces] on the walls."</P>

    "I prefer them [glaces, ices] on my plate," said Favourite.</P>

    Blachevelle persisted:--</P>

    "Look at the knives. The handles are of silver at Bombarda's and of bone at Edon's. Now, silver is more valuable than bone."</P>

    "Except for those who have a silver chin," observed Tholomyes.</P>

    He was looking at the dome of the Invalides, which was visible from Bombarda's windows.</P>

    A pause ensued.</P>

    "Tholomyes," exclaimed Fameuil, "Listolier and I were having a discussion just now."</P>

    "A discussion is a good thing," replied Tholomyes; "a quarrel is better."</P>

    "We were disputing about philosophy."</P>

    "Well?"</P>

    "Which do you prefer, Descartes or Spinoza?"</P>

    "Desaugiers," said Tholomyes.</P>

    This decree pronounced, he took a drink, and went on:--</P>

    "I consent to live. All is not at an end on earth since we can still talk nonsense. For that I return thanks to the immortal gods. We lie. One lies, but one laughs. One affirms, but one doubts. The unexpected bursts forth from the syllogism. That is fine. There are still human beings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of the paradox merrily. This, ladies, which you are drinking with so tranquil an air is Madeira wine, you must know, from the vineyard of Coural das Freiras, which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of the sea. Attention while you drink! three hundred and seventeen fathoms! and Monsieur Bombarda, the magnificent eating-house keeper, gives you those three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs and fifty centimes."</P>

    Again Fameuil interrupted him:--</P>

    "Tholomyes, your opinions fix the law. Who is your favorite author?"</P>

    "Ber--"</P>

    "Quin?"</P>

    "No; Choux."</P>

    And Tholomyes continued:--</P>

    "Honor to Bombarda! He would equal Munophis of Elephanta if he could but get me an Indian dancing-girl, and Thygelion of Chaeronea if he could bring me a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies! There were Bombardas in Greece and in Egypt. Apuleius tells us of them. Alas! always the same, and nothing new; nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation! Nil sub sole novum, says Solomon; amor omnibus idem, says Virgil; and Carabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud, as Aspasia embarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos. One last word. Do you know what Aspasia was, ladies? Although she lived at an epoch when women had, as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a soul of a rosy and purple hue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn. Aspasia was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met; she was the goddess prostitute; Socrates plus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was created in case a mistress should be needed for Prometheus."</P>

    Tholomyes, once started, would have found some difficulty in stopping, had not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment. The shock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt. It was a Beauceron mare, old and thin, and one fit for the knacker, which was dragging a very heavy cart. On arriving in front of Bombarda's, the worn-out, exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further. This incident attracted a crowd. Hardly had the cursing and indignant carter had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, Matin (the jade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, when the jade fell, never to rise again. On hearing the hubbub made by the passersby, Tholomyes' merry auditors turned their heads, and Tholomyes took advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with this melancholy strophe:--</P>

    "Elle etait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses[3]</P>

    Ont le meme destin; Et, rosse, elle a vecu ce que vivant les rosses, L'espace d'un matin!"</P>

    [3] She belonged to that circle where cuckoos and carriages share the same fate; and a jade herself, she lived, as jades live, for the space of a morning (or jade).</P>

    "Poor horse!" sighed Fantine.</P>

    And Dahlia exclaimed:--</P>

    "There is Fantine on the point of crying over horses. How can one be such a pitiful fool as that!"</P>

    At that moment Favourite, folding her arms and throwing her head back, looked resolutely at Tholomyes and said:--</P>

    "Come, now! the surprise?"</P>

    "Exactly. The moment has arrived," replied Tholomyes. "Gentlemen, the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck. Wait for us a moment, ladies."</P>

    "It begins with a kiss," said Blachevelle.</P>

    "On the brow," added Tholomyes.</P>

    Each gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress's brow; then all four filed out through the door, with their fingers on their lips.</P>

    Favourite clapped her hands on their departure.</P>

    "It is beginning to be amusing already," said she.</P>

    "Don't be too long," murmured Fantine; "we are waiting for you."</P>

    “爱同饭店比蓬巴达酒家好。”瑟芬叫着说。</P>

    “我喜欢蓬巴达胜过爱同，”勃拉什维尔说，“这里来得阔绰些，有些亚洲味儿。你们看下面的那间大厅，四面墙上都有镜子。”</P>

    “我只注意盘子里的东西。”宠儿说。</P>

    勃拉什维尔一再坚持说：</P>

    “你们瞧这些刀子。在蓬巴达酒家里刀柄是银的，在爱同店里是骨头的。银子当然比骨头贵重些。”</P>

    “对那些装了银下巴的人来说，这话却不对。”多罗米埃说。</P>

    这时他从蓬巴达的窗口望着残废军人院的圆屋顶。</P>

    大家寂静下来。</P>

    “多罗米埃，”法梅依叫道，“刚才李士多里和我辩论了一番。”</P>

    “辩论固然好，相骂更加妙。”多罗米埃回答。</P>

    “我们辩论哲学问题。”</P>

    “哼。”</P>

    “你喜欢笛卡儿还是斯宾诺莎①？” </P>

    ①斯宾诺莎（Spinosa），十八世纪荷兰唯物主义哲学家。</P>

    “我喜欢德佐吉埃①。”多罗米埃说。</P>

    下了那判词以后，他又喝酒，接着说：</P>

    “活在世上，我是同意的。世界上并不是一切都完蛋了的，既然我们还可以胡思乱想。因此我感谢永生的众神。我们说谎，但我们会发笑，我们一面肯定，但我们一面也怀疑。三段论里常出岔子。有趣。这世上究竟还有一些人能洋洋得意地从那些与众不同的见解中拿出一些特别玩意儿。诸位女士，你们安安静静喝着的那些东西是从马德拉②来的酒，你们应当知道，是古拉尔·达·弗莱拉斯地方的产品，那里超出海面三百十七个脱阿斯③！喝酒时你们应当注意这三百十七个脱阿斯！而那位漂亮的饭店老板蓬巴达凭着这三百十七个脱阿斯，却只卖你们四法郎五十生丁④！”</P>

    法梅依重行把话打断了：</P>

    “多罗米埃，你的意见等于法律。哪一个作家是你所最欣赏的？”</P>

    “贝尔……。”</P>

    “贝尔坎⑤！”</P>

    “不对，贝尔舒⑥。” </P>

    ①德佐吉埃（Desaugiers），当时歌手。</P>

    ②马德拉群岛（Madère），在大西详，葡萄牙殖民地。</P>

    ③脱阿斯（toise），约等于二公尺。</P>

    ④生丁（centime），法国辅币名，等于百分之一法郎，又译“分”。</P>

    ⑤贝尔坎（Berquin，1747-1791），法国文学家。</P>

    ⑥贝尔舒Berchoux，十九世纪法国一个食谱作者。</P>

    多罗米埃又接下去说：</P>

    光荣属于蓬巴达！假使他能为我招来一个埃及舞女，他就可以和艾勒芳达的缪诺菲斯媲美；假使他能为我送来一个希腊名妓，他就可以和喀洛内的迪瑞琳媲美了！因为，呵，女士们，希腊和埃及，也有过蓬巴达呢。那是阿普列乌斯①告诉我们的。可惜世界永远是老一套，绝没有什么新东西。在造物主的创作里，再也没有什么未发表的东西，所罗门说过：‘在太阳下面没有新奇的事物。’维吉尔②说过：‘各人的爱全是一样的。’今天的男学生和女学生走上圣克鲁的篷船，正和从前亚斯巴昔和伯利克里③乘舰队去萨摩斯一样。最后一句话。诸位女士，你们知道亚斯巴昔是什么人吗？她虽然生在女子还没有灵魂的时代，她却是一个灵魂，是一个紫红色的比火更灿烂、比朝暾更鲜艳的灵魂。亚斯巴昔是个兼有女性两个极端性的人儿，她是一个神妓，是苏格拉底④和曼侬·列斯戈⑤的混合体。亚斯巴昔是为了普罗米修斯⑥需要一个尤物的原故而生的。” </P>

    ①阿普列乌斯（Apulée，约123-约180），罗马作家，哲学家，《变形记》和《金驴》的作者。</P>

    ②维吉尔（Virgile，前70-19），杰出的罗马诗人。③伯利克里（Périclès，约前490一429），雅典政治家，亚斯巴昔是他的妻子。萨摩斯是他征服的一个岛。</P>

    ④苏格拉底（Socrate，约前469-399），古希腊唯心主义哲学家，奴隶主贵族思想家。</P>

    ⑤曼侬·列斯戈ManonLescaut，十八世纪法国作家普莱服所作小说《曼侬·列斯戈》中的女主角。</P>

    ⑥普罗米修斯Prométhée，希腊神话中窃火给人类的神。</P>

    假使当时没有一匹马倒在河沿上，高谈阔论的多罗米埃是难于住嘴的。由于那一冲击，那辆车子和这位高谈阔论者都一齐停下来了。一匹又老又瘦只配送给屠夫的博斯母马，拉着一辆很重的车子。那头精疲力竭的牲口走到蓬巴达的门前，不肯再走了。这件意外的事引来不少观众。一面咒骂、一面生气的车夫举起鞭子，对准目标，狠狠一鞭下去，同时嘴里骂着“贱畜牲”时，那匹老马已倒在地上永不再起了。在行人轰动声中多罗米埃的那些愉快的听众全掉转头去看了，多罗米埃趁这机会念了这样一节忧伤的诗来结束他的演讲：</P>

    在这世界上，</P>

    小车和大车，</P>

    命运都一样；</P>

    它是匹劣马，</P>

    活得象老狗，</P>

    所以和其他劣马一样。①</P>

    “怪可怜的马。”芳汀叹着说。</P>

    于是大丽叫起来了： </P>

    ①有这样一首悼念幼女夭亡的古诗：</P>

    Mais elle était du monde où les plus belles cnoses</P>

    Ont le pire destin，</P>

    Et，rose ell a vécu ce que vivent les roses，</P>

    L'espace d'un matin</P>

    诗的大意是：在这世界上，最美丽的东西，命运也最坏，她是一朵玫瑰，所以和玫瑰一样，只活了一个早晨。多罗米埃把这首诗改动了几个字，用来悼念那匹死马，主要是以“驽马”rosse代“玫瑰”rose，“恶狗”（matin）代“早晨”（matin），结果这诗的内容就变成现在这个样子。</P>

    “你们瞧芳汀，她为那些马也叫屈了！有这样蠢的人！”</P>

    这时宠儿交叉起两条胳膊，仰着头，定睛望着多罗米埃说：</P>

    “够了够了！还有那古怪玩意儿呢？”</P>

    “正是呵。时候已经到了，”多罗米埃回答说，“诸位先生，送各位女士一件古怪玩意儿的时候已经到了。诸位女士，请等一会儿。”</P>

    “先亲一个嘴。”勃拉什维尔说。</P>

    “亲额。”多罗米埃加上一句。</P>

    每个人在他情妇的额上郑重地吻了一下，四个男人鱼贯而出，都把一个手指放在嘴上。</P>

    宠儿鼓着掌，送他们出去。</P>

    “已经很有意思了。”她说。</P>

    “不要去得太久了，”芳汀低声说，“我们等着你们呢。”</P>

 Part 1 Book 3 Chapter 9 A Merry End to Mirth

    When the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on the window-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking from one window to the other.</P>

    They saw the young men emerge from the Cafe Bombarda arm in arm. The latter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared in that dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the Champs-Elysees.</P>

    "Don't be long!" cried Fantine.</P>

    "What are they going to bring us?" said Zephine.</P>

    "It will certainly be something pretty," said Dahlia.</P>

    "For my part," said Favourite, "I want it to be of gold."</P>

    Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees, and which diverted them greatly.</P>

    It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences. Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the Champs-Elysees. The majority followed the quay and went through the Passy Barrier. From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow and black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless by trunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediately disappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge, with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements, changing all the paving-stones into steels. This uproar delighted the young girls. Favourite exclaimed:--</P>

    "What a row! One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away."</P>

    It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out again at a gallop. This surprised Fantine.</P>

    "That's odd!" said she. "I thought the diligence never stopped."</P>

    Favourite shrugged her shoulders.</P>

    "This Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I am a traveller; I say to the diligence, `I will go on in advance; you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass.' The diligence passes, sees me, halts, and takes me. That is done every day. You do not know life, my dear."</P>

    In this manner a certain time elapsed. All at once Favourite made a movement, like a person who is just waking up.</P>

    "Well," said she, "and the surprise?"</P>

    "Yes, by the way," joined in Dahlia, "the famous surprise?"</P>

    "They are a very long time about it!" said Fantine.</P>

    As Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them at dinner entered. He held in his hand something which resembled a letter.</P>

    "What is that?" demanded Favourite.</P>

    The waiter replied:--</P>

    "It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies."</P>

    "Why did you not bring it at once?"</P>

    "Because," said the waiter, "the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour."</P>

    Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter's hand. It was, in fact, a letter.</P>

    "Stop!" said she; "there is no address; but this is what is written on it--"</P>

    "THIS IS THE SURPRISE."</P>

    She tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she knew how to read]:--</P>

    "OUR BELOVED:--</P>

    "You must know that we have parents. Parents--you do not know much about such things. They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code, which is puerile and honest. Now, these parents groan, these old folks implore us, these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons; they desire our return, and offer to kill calves for us. Being virtuous, we obey them. At the hour when you read this, five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas. We are pulling up our stakes, as Bossuet says. We are going; we are gone. We flee in the arms of Lafitte and on the wings of Caillard. The Toulouse diligence tears us from the abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties! We return to society, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, at the rate of three leagues an hour. It is necessary for the good of the country that we should be, like the rest of the world, prefects, fathers of families, rural police, and councillors of state. Venerate us. We are sacrificing ourselves. Mourn for us in haste, and replace us with speed. If this letter lacerates you, do the same by it. Adieu.</P>

    "For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy. We bear you no grudge for that.</P>

    "Signed:</P>

    BLACHEVELLE.</P>

    FAMUEIL.</P>

    LISTOLIER.</P>

    FELIX THOLOMYES.</P>

    "Postscriptum. The dinner is paid for."</P>

    The four young women looked at each other.</P>

    Favourite was the first to break the silence.</P>

    "Well!" she exclaimed, "it's a very pretty farce, all the same."</P>

    "It is very droll," said Zephine.</P>

    "That must have been Blachevelle's idea," resumed Favourite. "It makes me in love with him. No sooner is he gone than he is loved. This is an adventure, indeed."</P>

    "No," said Dahlia; "it was one of Tholomyes' ideas. That is evident.</P>

    "In that case," retorted Favourite, "death to Blachevelle, and long live Tholomyes!"</P>

    "Long live Tholomyes!" exclaimed Dahlia and Zephine.</P>

    And they burst out laughing.</P>

    Fantine laughed with the rest.</P>

    An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept. It was her first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself to this Tholomyes as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.</P>

    那几位姑娘独自留下，两个两个地伏在窗子边上闲谈，伸着头，隔窗对语。</P>

    她们看见那些年轻人挽着手走出蓬巴达酒家。他们回转头来，笑嘻嘻对着她们挥了挥手，便消失在爱丽舍广场每周都有的那种星期日的尘嚣中去了。</P>

    “不要去得太久了！”芳汀喊着说。</P>

    “他们预备带什么玩意儿回来给我们呢？”瑟芬说。</P>

    “那一定是些好看的东西。”大丽说。</P>

    “我呢，”宠儿说，“我希望带回来的东西是金的。”</P>

    她们从那些大树的枝桠间望着水边的活动，觉得也很有趣，不久就忘记那回事了。那正是邮车和公共马车起程的时刻。当时到南部和西部去的客货，几乎全要走过爱丽舍广场，大部分顺着河沿，经过巴喜便门出去。每隔一分钟，就会有一辆刷了黄漆和黑漆的大车，载着沉重的东西，马蹄铁链响成一片，箱、箧、提包堆到不成样子，车子里人头攒动，一眨眼全都走了，碾踏着街心，疯狂地穿过人堆，路面上的石块尽成了燧石，尘灰滚滚，就好象是从炼铁炉里冒出的火星和浓烟。几位姑娘见了那种热闹大为兴奋，宠儿喊着说：</P>

    “多么热闹！就象一堆堆铁链在飞着。”</P>

    一次，她们仿佛看见有辆车子（由于榆树的枝叶过于浓密，她们看不大清楚）停了一下，随即又飞跑去了。这事惊动了芳汀。</P>

    “这真奇怪！”她说。“我还以为公共客车从不停的呢。”</P>

    宠儿耸了耸肩。</P>

    “这个芳汀真特别，我刚才故意望着她。最简单的事她也要大惊小怪。假如我是个旅客，我关照公共客车说：‘我要到前面去一下，您经过河沿时让我上车。客车来了看见我，停下来，让我上去。’这是每天都有的事。你脱离现实生活了，我亲爱的。”</P>

    那样过了一些时候，宠儿忽然一动，仿佛一个初醒的人。</P>

    “喂，”她说，“他们要送我们的古怪玩意儿呢？”“是呀，正是这话，”大丽接着说，“那闹了半天的古怪玩意儿呢？”</P>

    “他们耽搁得太久了！”芳汀说。</P>

    芳汀正叹完这口气，伺候晚餐的那个堂倌走进来了，他手里捏着一件东西，好象是封信。</P>

    “这是什么？”宠儿问。</P>

    堂倌回答说：</P>

    “这是那几位先生留给太太们的一张条子。</P>

    “为什么没有马上送来？”</P>

    “因为那些先生们吩咐过的，”堂倌接着说，“要过了一个钟头才交给这几位太太。”</P>

    宠儿从那堂倌手里把那张纸夺过来。那确是一封信。</P>

    “奇怪，”她说，“没有收信人的姓名，但有这几个字写在上面：</P>

    这就是古怪玩意儿。</P>

    她急忙把信拆开，打开来念（她识字）：</P>

    呵，我们的情妇！</P>

    你们应当知道，我们是有双亲的人。双亲，这是你们不大知道的。在幼稚而诚实的民法里，那叫做父亲和母亲。那些亲人，长者，慈祥的老公公，慈祥的老婆婆，他们老叫苦，老想看看我们，叫我们做浪子，盼望我们回去，并且要为我们宰牛宰羊。我们现在服从他们。因为我们是有品德的人。你们念这时信时，五匹怒马已把我们送还给我们的爸爸妈妈了。正如博须埃所说，我们拆台了。我们走了，我们已经走了。我们在拉菲特的怀中，在加亚尔①的翅膀上逃了。去图卢兹的公共客车已把我们从陷阱中拔了出来。陷阱，就是你们，呵，我们美丽的小姑娘！我们回到社会、天职、秩序中去了，马蹄得得，每小时要走三法里，祖国需要我们，和旁人一样，去做长官，做家长，做乡吏，做政府顾问。要尊敬我们。我们正在作一种牺牲。快快为我们哭一场。快快为我们找替身吧。假使这封信撕碎了你们的心，你们就照样向它报复，把它撕碎。永别了。</P>

    近两年来我们曾使你们幸福，千万不要埋怨我们。</P>

    勃拉什维尔　法梅依</P>

    李士多里　多罗米埃（签字） </P>

    ①拉菲特（Lafitte）和加亚尔（Caillard）均为当时负责客车事务的官员。</P>

    附告：餐费已付。</P>

    那四位姑娘面面相觑。</P>

    宠儿第一个打破沉寂。</P>

    “好呀，”她喊着说，“这玩笑确是开得不坏。”</P>

    “很有趣。”瑟芬说。</P>

    “这一定是勃拉什维尔出的主意，”宠儿又说，“这倒使我爱他了。人不在，心头爱，人总是这样的。”</P>

    “不对，”大丽说，“这是多罗米埃的主意。一望便知。”</P>

    “既是这样，”宠儿又说，“勃拉什维尔该死，多罗米埃万岁！”</P>

    “多罗米埃万岁！”大丽和瑟芬都喊起来。</P>

    接着，她们放声大笑。</P>

    芳汀也随着大家笑。</P>

    一个钟头过后，她回到了自己的屋子里，她哭出来了。我们已经说过，这是她第一次的爱。她早已如同委身于自己的丈夫一样委身于多罗米埃了，并且这可怜的姑娘已生有一个孩子。</P>

 Part 1 Book 4 Chapter 1 One Mother meets Another Mother

    There was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of this century, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists. This cook-shop was kept by some people named Thenardier, husband and wife. It was situated in Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots represented blood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probably represented a battle. Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF SERGEANT OF WATERLOO (Au Sargent de Waterloo).</P>

    Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry. Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the fragment of a vehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of the Sergeant of Waterloo, one evening in the spring of 1818, would certainly have attracted, by its mass, the attention of any painter who had passed that way.</P>

    It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, and which was supported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact, overwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an enormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, the fellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous yellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the iron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain, worthy of some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not the beams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of the galleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and it seemed to have been detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus with it, and Shakespeare, Caliban.</P>

    Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? In the first place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it might finish the process of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in the old social order, which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than the above.</P>

    The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and in the loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped, on that particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two little girls; one about two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months; the younger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted about them, prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight of that frightful chain, and had said, "Come! there's a plaything for my children."</P>

    The two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance, were radiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks were full of laughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their innocent faces were two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them; the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood. Above and around these two delicate heads, all made of happiness and steeped in light, the gigantic fore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, all entangled in curves and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern. A few paces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry, the mother, not a very prepossessing woman, by the way, though touching at that moment, was swinging the two children by means of a long cord, watching them carefully, for fear of accidents, with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity. At every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound, which resembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in ecstasies; the setting sun mingled in this joy, and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the swing of cherubim.</P>

    As she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated:--</P>

    "It must be, said a warrior."</P>

    Her song, and the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street.</P>

    In the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear:--</P>

    "You have two beautiful children there, Madame."</P>

    "To the fair and tender Imogene--"</P>

    replied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head.</P>

    A woman stood before her, a few paces distant. This woman also had a child, which she carried in her arms.</P>

    She was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed very heavy.</P>

    This woman's child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold. lt was a girl, two or three years of age. She could have entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen, ribbons on her bodice, and Valenciennes lace on her cap. The folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white, firm, and dimpled leg. She was admirably rosy and healthy. The little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of her eyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very large, and that they had magnificent lashes. She was asleep.</P>

    She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age. The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleep profoundly.</P>

    As for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. She was dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again. She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire it was not apparent. Her hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemed very thick, but was severely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close, nun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance. She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child. A large blue handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a fichu, and concealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown, and coarse shoes. It was Fantine.</P>

    It was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on scrutinizing her attentively, it was evident that she still retained her beauty. A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony, wrinkled her right cheek. As for her toilette, that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, and of music, full of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight; it melts and leaves the branch quite black. Ten months had elapsed since the "pretty farce."</P>

    What had taken place during those ten months? It can be divined.</P>

    After abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediately lost sight of Favourite, Zephine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on the side of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that they had been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing. Fantine had remained alone. The father of her child gone,--alas! such ruptures are irrevocable,-- she found herself absolutely isolated, minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by her liaison with Tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew, she had neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to her. She had no resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not know how to write; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name; she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyes, then a second, then a third. Tholomyes replied to none of them. Fantine heard the gossips say, as they looked at her child: "Who takes those children seriously! One only shrugs one's shoulders over such children!" Then she thought of Tholomyes, who had shrugged his shoulders over his child, and who did not take that innocent being seriously; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man. But what was she to do? She no longer knew to whom to apply. She had committed a fault, but the foundation of her nature, as will be remembered, was modesty and virtue. She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress, and of gliding into a worse state. Courage was necessary; she possessed it, and held herself firm. The idea of returning to her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her. There, some one might possibly know her and give her work; yes, but it would be necessary to conceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one. Her heart contracted, but she took her resolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had the fierce bravery of life. She had already valiantly renounced finery, had dressed herself in linen, and had put all her silks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons, and all her laces on her daughter, the only vanity which was left to her, and a holy one it was. She sold all that she had, which produced for her two hundred francs; her little debts paid, she had only about eighty francs left. At the age of twenty-two, on a beautiful spring morning, she quitted Paris, bearing her child on her back. Any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them. This woman had, in all the world, nothing but her child, and the child had, in all the world, no one but this woman. Fantine had nursed her child, and this had tired her chest, and she coughed a little.</P>

    We shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Felix Tholomyes. Let us confine ourselves to saying, that, twenty years later, under King Louis Philippe, he was a great provincial lawyer, wealthy and influential, a wise elector, and a very severe juryman; he was still a man of pleasure.</P>

    Towards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for the sake of resting herself, travelled, for three or four sous a league, in what was then known as the Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris, the "little suburban coach service," Fantine found herself at Montfermeil, in the alley Boulanger.</P>

    As she passed the Thenardier hostelry, the two little girls, blissful in the monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, and she had halted in front of that vision of joy.</P>

    Charms exist. These two little girls were a charm to this mother.</P>

    She gazed at them in much emotion. The presence of angels is an announcement of Paradise. She thought that, above this inn, she beheld the mysterious HERE of Providence. These two little creatures were evidently happy. She gazed at them, she admired them, in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets of her song, she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read:--</P>

    "You have two pretty children, Madame."</P>

    The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young.</P>

    The mother raised her head and thanked her, and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door, she herself being seated on the threshold. The two women began to chat.</P>

    "My name is Madame Thenardier," said the mother of the two little girls. "We keep this inn."</P>

    Then, her mind still running on her romance, she resumed humming between her teeth:--</P>

    "It must be so; I am a knight, And I am off to Palestine."</P>

    This Madame Thenardier was a sandy-complexioned woman, thin and angular-- the type of the soldier's wife in all its unpleasantness; and what was odd, with a languishing air, which she owed to her perusal of romances. She was a simpering, but masculine creature. Old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop woman. She was still young; she was barely thirty. If this crouching woman had stood upright, her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs, might have frightened the traveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish. A person who is seated instead of standing erect--destinies hang upon such a thing as that.</P>

    The traveller told her story, with slight modifications.</P>

    That she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; that her work in Paris had failed her, and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere, in her own native parts; that she had left Paris that morning on foot; that, as she was carrying her child, and felt fatigued, she had got into the Villemomble coach when she met it; that from Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot; that the little one had walked a little, but not much, because she was so young, and that she had been obliged to take her up, and the jewel had fallen asleep.</P>

    At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss, which woke her. The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother's, and looked at--what? Nothing; with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children, which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue. One would say that they feel themselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men. Then the child began to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run. All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing, stopped short, and put out her tongue, in sign of admiration.</P>

    Mother Thenardier released her daughters, made them descend from the swing, and said:--</P>

    "Now amuse yourselves, all three of you."</P>

    Children become acquainted quickly at that age, and at the expiration of a minute the little Thenardiers were playing with the new-comer at making holes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure.</P>

    The new-comer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel, and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly. The grave-digger's business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child.</P>

    The two women pursued their chat.</P>

    "What is your little one's name?"</P>

    "Cosette."</P>

    For Cosette, read Euphrasie. The child's name was Euphrasie. But out of Euphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha into Pepita, and Francoise into Sillette. It is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists. We have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon.</P>

    "How old is she?"</P>

    "She is going on three."</P>

    "That is the age of my eldest."</P>

    In the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissfulness; an event had happened; a big worm had emerged from the ground, and they were afraid; and they were in ecstasies over it.</P>

    Their radiant brows touched each other; one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole.</P>

    "How easily children get acquainted at once!" exclaimed Mother Thenardier; "one would swear that they were three sisters!"</P>

    This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for. She seized the Thenardier's hand, looked at her fixedly, and said:--</P>

    "Will you keep my child for me?"</P>

    The Thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent nor refusal.</P>

    Cosette's mother continued:--</P>

    "You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will not permit it. With a child one can find no situation. People are ridiculous in the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn. When I caught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean, and so happy, it overwhelmed me. I said: `Here is a good mother. That is just the thing; that will make three sisters.' And then, it will not be long before I return. Will you keep my child for me?"</P>

    "I must see about it," replied the Thenardier.</P>

    "I will give you six francs a month."</P>

    Here a man's voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:--</P>

    "Not for less than seven francs. And six months paid in advance."</P>

    "Six times seven makes forty-two," said the Thenardier.</P>

    "I will give it," said the mother.</P>

    "And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses," added the man's voice.</P>

    "Total, fifty-seven francs," said Madame Thenardier. And she hummed vaguely, with these figures:--</P>

    "It must be, said a warrior."</P>

    "I will pay it," said the mother. "I have eighty francs. I shall have enough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot. I shall earn money there, and as soon as I have a little I will return for my darling."</P>

    The man's voice resumed:--</P>

    "The little one has an outfit?"</P>

    "That is my husband," said the Thenardier.</P>

    "Of course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.--I understood perfectly that it was your husband.--And a beautiful outfit, too! a senseless outfit, everything by the dozen, and silk gowns like a lady. It is here, in my carpet-bag."</P>

    "You must hand it over," struck in the man's voice again.</P>

    "Of course I shall give it to you," said the mother. "It would be very queer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked!"</P>

    The master's face appeared.</P>

    "That's good," said he.</P>

    The bargain was concluded. The mother passed the night at the inn, gave up her money and left her child, fastened her carpet-bag once more, now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, and light henceforth and set out on the following morning, intending to return soon. People arrange such departures tranquilly; but they are despairs!</P>

    A neighbor of the Thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out, and came back with the remark:--</P>

    "I have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to rend your heart."</P>

    When Cosette's mother had taken her departure, the man said to the woman:--</P>

    "That will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which falls due to-morrow; I lacked fifty francs. Do you know that I should have had a bailiff and a protest after me? You played the mouse-trap nicely with your young ones."</P>

    "Without suspecting it," said the woman.</P>

    本世纪的最初二十五年中，在巴黎附近的孟费郿地方有一家大致象饭店那样的客店，现在已经不在了。这客店是名叫德纳第的夫妇俩开的。开在面包师巷。店门头上有块木板，平钉在墙上。板上画了些东西，仿佛是个人，那人背上背着另一个带有将军级的金色大肩章、章上还有几颗大银星的人；画上还有一些红斑纹，代表血；其余部分全是烟尘，大致是要描绘战场上的情景。木板的下端有这样几个字：滑铁卢中士客寓。</P>

    一个客店门前停辆榻车或小车原是件最平常的事。但在一八一八年春季的一天傍晚，在那滑铁卢中士客寓门前停着的那辆阻塞街道的大车（不如说一辆车子的残骸），却足以吸引过路画家的注意。</P>

    那是一辆在森林地区用来装运厚木板和树身的重型货车的前半部。它的组成部分是一条装在两个巨轮上的粗笨铁轴和一条嵌在轴上的粗笨辕木。整体是庞大、笨重、奇形怪状的，就象一架大炮的座子。车轮、轮边、轮心、轮轴和辕木上面都被沿路的泥坑涂上了一层黄污泥浆，颇象一般人喜欢用来修饰天主堂的那种灰浆。木质隐在泥浆里，铁质隐在铁锈里，车轴下面，横挂着一条适合苦役犯歌利亚①的粗链。那条链子不会使人想到它所捆载的巨材，却使人想到它所能驾驭的乳齿象和猛犸；它那模样，好象是从监狱（巨魔和超人的监狱）里出来的，也好象是从一个奴怪身上解下来的。荷马一定会用它来缚住波吕菲摩斯，莎士沈亚用来缚住凯列班。 </P>

    ①歌利亚（Goliath），《圣经》中所载为大卫王所杀之非利士巨人。</P>

    为什么那辆重型货车的前都会停在那街心呢？首先，为了阻塞道路；其次，为了让它锈完。在旧社会组织中，就有许许多多这类机构，也同样明目张胆地堵在路上，并没有其他存在的理由。</P>

    那亸下的链条，中段离地颇近，黄昏时有两个小女孩，一个大致两岁半，一个十八个月，并排坐在那链条的弯处，如同坐在秋千索上，小的那个躺在大的怀中，亲亲热热地相互拥抱着。一条手帕巧妙地系住她们，免得她们摔下。有个母亲最初看见那条丑链条时，她说：“嘿！这家伙可以做我孩子们的玩意儿。”</P>

    那两个欢欢喜喜的孩子，确也打扮得惹人爱，是有人细心照顾的，就象废铁中的两朵蔷薇；她们的眼睛，神气十足，鲜润的脸蛋儿笑嘻嘻的。一个的头发是栗色，另一个是棕色。她们天真的面庞露着又惊又喜的神气。附近有一丛野花对着行人频送香味，人家总以为那香味是从她们那里来的。十八个月的那个，天真烂漫，露出她那赤裸裸、怪可爱的小肚皮。在这两个幸福无边、娇艳夺目的小宝贝的顶上，立着那个高阔的车架，黑锈满身，形相丑陋，满是纵横交错、张牙舞爪的曲线和棱角，好比野人洞口的门拱。几步以外，有一个面目并不可爱但此刻却很令人感动的大娘，那就是她们的母亲；她正蹲在那客店门口，用一根长绳拉荡着那两个孩子，眼睛紧紧盯着她们，唯恐发生意外。她那神气，既象猛兽又象天神，除了母亲，别人不会那样。那些怪难看的链环，每荡一次，都象发脾气似的发出一种锐利的叫声。那两个小女孩乐得出神，斜阳也正从旁助兴。天意的诡谲使一条巨魔的铁链成了小天使们的秋千，世间没有比这更有趣的事了。</P>

    母亲，一面荡着她的两个孩子，一面用一种不准确的音调哼着一首当时流行的情歌：</P>

    必须如此，一个战士……</P>

    她的歌声和她对那两个女儿的注意，使她听不见、也看不见街上发生的事。</P>

    正当她开始唱那首情歌的第一节，就已有人走近她身边，她忽然听见有人在她耳边说：</P>

    “大嫂，您的两个小宝宝真可爱。”</P>

    对美丽温柔的伊默琴说，</P>

    那母亲唱着情歌来表示回答，随又转过头来。</P>

    原来是个妇人站在她面前，隔开她只几步远。那妇人也有个孩子抱在怀里。</P>

    此外，她还挽着一个好象很重的随身大衣包。</P>

    那妇人的孩子是个小仙女似的孩子。是一个两三岁的女孩。她衣服装饰的艳丽很可以和那两个孩子赛一下。她戴一顶细绸小帽，帽上有瓦朗斯①花边，披一件有飘带的斗篷。掀起裙子就看见她那雪白、肥嫩、坚实的大腿。她面色红润，身体健康，着实可爱。两颊鲜艳得象苹果，教人见了恨不得咬它一口。她的眼睛一定是很大的，一定还有非常秀丽的睫毛，我们不能再说什么，因为她正睡着。 </P>

    ①瓦朗斯（Valence），法国城市，以产花边著名。</P>

    她睡得多甜呀！只有在她那种小小年纪才能那样绝无顾虑地睡着。慈母的胳膊是慈爱构成的，孩子们睡在里面怎能不甜？</P>

    至于那母亲却是种贫苦忧郁的模样，她的装束象个女工，却又露出一些想要重做农妇的迹象，她还年轻。她美吗？也许，但由于那种装束，她并不显得美。她头发里的一绺金发露了出来，显出她头发的丰厚，但是她用一条丑而窄的巫婆用的头巾紧紧结在颏下，把头发全遮住了。人可以在笑时露出美丽的牙齿，但是她一点也不笑。她的眼睛仿佛还没有干多久。她脸上没有血色，显得非常疲乏，象有病似的。她瞧着睡在她怀里的女儿的那种神情只有亲自哺乳的母亲才会有。一条对角折的粗蓝布大手巾，就是伤兵们用来擤鼻涕的那种大手巾，遮去了她的腰。她的手，枯而黑，生满了斑点，食指上的粗皮满是针痕，肩上披一件蓝色的粗羊毛氅，布裙袍，大鞋。她就是芳汀。</P>

    她就是芳汀。已经很难认了。但是仔细看去，她的美不减当年。一条含愁的皱痕横在她的右脸上，仿佛是冷笑的起始。至于装束，她从前那种镶缀丝带、散发丁香味儿、狂态十足的轻罗华服，好象是愉快、狂欢和音乐构成的装饰，早已象日光下和金刚钻一样耀眼的树上霜花那样消失殆尽了，霜花融化以后，留下的只是深黑的树枝。</P>

    那次的“妙玩笑”开过以后，已经过了十个月了。</P>

    在这十个月中发生了什么事呢？那是可以想见的。</P>

    遗弃之后，便是艰苦。芳汀完全见不着宠儿、瑟芬和大丽了；从男子方面断绝了的关系，在女子方面也拆散了；假使有人在十五天过后说她们从前是朋友，她们一定会感到奇怪，现在已没有再做朋友的理由了。芳汀只是孤零零的一个人。她孩子的父亲走了，真惨！这种绝交是无可挽回的，她孑然一身，无亲无故，加以劳动的习惯减少了，娱乐的嗜好加多了，自从和多罗米埃发生关系以后，她便轻视她从前学得的那些小手艺，她忽视了自己的出路，现在已是无路可通了。毫无救星。芳汀稍稍认识几个字，但不知道写，在她年幼时，人家只教过她签自己的名字。她曾请一个摆写字摊的先生写了一封信给多罗米埃，随后又写了第二封，随后又写了第三封。多罗米埃一封也没有答复。一天，芳汀听见一些贫嘴薄舌的女人望着她的孩子说：“谁会认这种孩子？对这种孩子，大家耸耸肩就完了！”于是她想到多罗米埃一定也对她的孩子耸肩，不会认这无辜的小人儿的，想到那男人，她的心灰了。但是作什么打算呢？她已不知道应当向谁求教。她犯了错误，但是我们记得，她的本质是贞洁贤淑的。她隐隐地感到，她不久就会堕入苦难，沉溺在更加不堪的境地里。她非得有毅力不行；她有毅力，于是她站稳脚跟。她忽然想到要回到她家乡滨海蒙特勒伊去，在那里也许会有人认识她，给她工作。这打算不错，不过得先隐瞒她的错误。于是她隐隐看出，可能又要面临生离的苦痛了，而这次的生离的苦痛是会比上一次更甚的。她的心扭作一团，但是她下定决心。芳汀，我们将来可以知道，是敢于大胆正视人生的。</P>

    她已毅然决然摈弃了修饰，自己穿着布衣，把她所有的丝织品、碎料子、飘带、花边，都用在她女儿身上，这女儿是她仅有的虚荣。她变卖了所有的东西，得到二百法郎，还清各处的零星债务后她只有八十来个法郎了。在二十二岁的芳龄，一个晴朗的春天的早晨，她背着她的孩子，离开了巴黎。如果有人看见她们母女俩走过，谁也会心酸。那妇人在世上只有这个孩子，那孩子在世上也只有这个妇人。芳汀喂过她女儿的奶，她的胸脯亏累了，因而有点咳嗽。</P>

    我们以后不会再有机会谈到斐利克斯·多罗米埃先生了。我们只说，二十年后，在路易·菲力浦王朝时代①，他是外省一个满脸横肉、有钱有势的公家律师，一个乖巧的选民，一个很严厉的审判官，一个一贯寻芳猎艳的登徒子。 </P>

    ①即一八三○年至一八四八年。</P>

    芳汀坐上当时称为巴黎郊区小车的那种车子，花上每法里三四个苏的车费，白天就到了孟费郿的面包师巷。</P>

    她从德纳第客店门前走过，看见那两个小女孩在那怪形秋千架上玩得怪起劲的，不禁心花怒放，只望着那幅欢乐的景象出神。</P>

    诱惑人的魑魅是有的。那两个女孩对这个做母亲的来说，便是这种魑魅。</P>

    她望着她们，大为感动。看见天使便如身历天堂，她仿佛看见在那客店上面有“上帝在此”的神秘字样。那两个女孩明明是那样快活！她望着她们，羡慕她们，异常感动，以至当那母亲在她两句歌词间换气时，她不能不对她说出我们刚才读到的那句话：</P>

    “大嫂，您的两个小宝宝真可爱。”</P>

    最凶猛的禽兽，见人家抚摸它的幼雏也会驯服起来的。母亲抬起头，道了谢，又请这位过路的女客坐在门边条凳上，她自己仍蹲在门槛上。两个妇人便攀谈起来了。</P>

    “我叫德纳第妈妈，”两个女孩的母亲说，“这客店是我们开的。”</P>

    随后，又回到她的情歌，合着牙哼起来：</P>

    必须这样，我是骑士，</P>

    我正要到巴勒斯坦去。</P>

    这位德纳第妈妈是个赤发、多肉、呼吸滞塞的妇人，是个典型的装妖作怪的母老虎。并且说也奇怪，她老象有满腔心事似的，那是由于她多读了几回香艳小说。她是那么一个扭扭捏捏、男不男女不女的家伙，那些已经破烂的旧小说，对一个客店老板娘的想象力来说，往往会产生这样的影响。她还年轻，不到三十岁。假使这个蹲着的妇人当时直立起来，她那魁梧奇伟、游艺场中活菩萨似的身材也许会立刻吓退那位女客，扰乱她的信心，而我们要叙述的事也就不会发生了。一个人的一起一坐竟会牵涉到许多人的命运。</P>

    远来的女客开始谈她的身世，不过谈得稍微与实际情况有些出入。</P>

    她说她是一个女工，丈夫死了，巴黎缺少工作，她要到别处去找工作，她要回到她的家乡去。当天早晨，她徒步离开了巴黎，因为她带着孩子，觉得疲倦了，恰巧遇着到蒙白耳城去的车子，她便坐了上去；从蒙白耳城到孟费郿，她是走来的；小的也走了一点路，但是不多，她太幼小，只得抱着她，她的宝贝睡着了。</P>

    说到此地，她热烈地吻了一下她的女儿，把她弄醒了。那个孩子睁开她的眼睛，大的蓝眼睛，和她母亲的一样，望着，望什么呢？什么也不望，什么也在望，用孩子们那副一本正经并且有时严肃的神气望着，那种神气正是他们光明的天真面对我们日益衰败的道德的一种神秘的表示。仿佛他们觉得自己是天使，又知道我们是凡人。随后那个孩子笑起来了，母亲虽然抱住她，但她用小生命跃跃欲试的那种无可约束的毅力滑到地上去了，忽然她看见了秋千上面的那两个孩子，立刻停止不动，伸出舌头，表示羡慕。</P>

    德纳第妈妈把她两个女儿解下了，叫她们从秋千上下来，说道：</P>

    “你们三个人一道玩吧。”</P>

    在那种年纪，大家很快就玩熟了，一分钟过后，那两个小德纳第姑娘便和这个新来的伴侣一道在地上掘洞了，其乐无穷。</P>

    这个新来的伴侣是很活泼有趣的，母亲的好心肠已在这个娃娃的快乐里表现出来了，她拿了一小块木片做铲子，用力掘了一个能容一只苍蝇的洞。掘墓穴工人的工作出自一个孩子的手，便有趣了。</P>

    两个妇人继续谈话。</P>

    “您的宝宝叫什么？”</P>

    “珂赛特。”</P>

    珂赛特应当是欧福拉吉。那孩子本来叫欧福拉吉。但是她母亲把欧福拉吉改成了珂赛特，这是母亲和平民常有的一种娴雅的本能，比方说，约瑟华往往变成贝比达，佛朗索瓦斯往往变成西莱特。这种字的转借法，绝不是字源学家的学问所能解释的。我们认得一个人的祖母，她居然把泰奥多尔变成了格农。</P>

    “她几岁了？”</P>

    “快三岁了。”</P>

    “正和我的大孩子一样。”</P>

    那时，那三个女孩聚在一堆，神气显得极其快乐，但又显得非常焦急，因为那时发生了一件大事：一条肥大的蚯蚓刚从地里钻出来，他们正看得出神。</P>

    她们的喜气洋洋的额头一个挨着一个，仿佛三个头同在一圈圆光里一样。</P>

    “这些孩子们，”德纳第妈妈大声说，“一下子就混熟了！别人一定认为她们是三个亲妹妹呢！”</P>

    那句话大致就是这个母亲所等待的火星吧。她握住德纳第妈妈的手，眼睛盯着她，向她说：</P>

    “您肯替我照顾我的孩子吗？”</P>

    德纳第妈妈一惊，那是一种既不表示同意，也不表示拒绝的动作。</P>

    珂赛特的母亲紧接着说：</P>

    “您明白吗，我不能把我的孩子领到家乡去。工作不允许那样做。带着孩子不会有安身的地方。在那地方，他们本是那样古怪的。慈悲的上帝教我从您客店门前走过，当我看见您的孩子那样好看、那样干净、那样高兴时，我的心早被打动了。我说过：‘这才真是个好母亲呵。’哟，她们真会成三个亲姊妹。并且，我不久就要回来的。您肯替我照顾我的孩子吗？”</P>

    “我得先想想。”德纳第妈妈说。</P>

    “我可以每月付六个法郎。”</P>

    说到这里，一个男子的声音从那客店的底里叫出来：</P>

    “非得七个法郎不成。并且要先付六个月。”</P>

    “六七四十二。”德纳第妈妈说。</P>

    “我照付就是。”那母亲说。</P>

    “并且另外要十五法郎，做刚接过手时的一切费用。”男子的声音又说。</P>

    “总共五十七法郎。”德纳第妈妈说。</P>

    提到这些数目时，她又很随便地哼起来：</P>

    必须这样，一个战士说。</P>

    “我照付就是，”那母亲说，“我有八十法郎。剩下的钱，尽够我盘缠，如果走去的话。到了那里，我就赚得到钱，等我有点钱的时候，我就回头来找我的心肝。”</P>

    男子的声音又说：</P>

    “那孩子有包袱吗？”</P>

    “那是我的丈夫。”德纳第妈妈说。</P>

    “当然她有一个包袱，这个可怜的宝贝。我早知道他是您的丈夫。并且还是一个装得满满的包袱！不过有点满得不近人情。里面的东西全是成打的，还有一些和贵妇人衣料一样的绸缎衣服。它就在我的随身衣包里。”</P>

    “您得把它交出来。”男子的声音又说。</P>

    “我当然要把它交出来！”母亲说，“我让我的女儿赤身露体，那才笑话呢！”</P>

    德纳第把主人的面孔摆出来了。</P>

    “很好。”他说。</P>

    这件买卖成交了。母亲在那客店里住了一夜，交出了她的钱，留下了她的孩子，重新结上她那只由于取出了孩子衣服而缩小、从此永远轻便的随身衣包，在第二天早晨走了，一心打算早早回来。人们对骨肉的离合总爱打如意算盘，但是往往落一场空。</P>

    德纳第夫妇的一个女邻居碰到了这位离去的母亲，她回来说：</P>

    “我刚才看见一个妇人在街上哭得好惨！”</P>

    珂赛特的母亲走了以后，那汉子对他婆娘说：</P>

    “这样我可以付我那张明天到期的一百一十法郎的期票了。先头我还缺五十法郎。你可知道？法院的执达吏快要把人家告发我的拒绝付款状给我送来了。这一下，你靠了你的两个孩子做了个财神娘娘。”</P>

    “我没有想到。”那婆娘说。</P>

 Part 1 Book 4 Chapter 2 First Sketch of Two Unprepossessing Figures

    The mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but the cat rejoices even over a lean mouse.</P>

    Who were these Thenardiers?</P>

    Let us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch later on.</P>

    These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful, and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale, which is between the class called "middle" and the class denominated as "inferior," and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois.</P>

    They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to warm them up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a substratum of the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard. Both were susceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist crab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness, retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience to augment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man and woman possessed such souls.</P>

    Thenardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One can only look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are dark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front. There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future.</P>

    This Thenardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier-- a sergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815, and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We shall see later on how much truth there was in this. The sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted it himself; for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.</P>

    It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after having been Clelie, was no longer anything but Lodoiska, still noble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle de Scuderi to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Barthelemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. Madame Thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books. She lived on them. In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This had given her, when very young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the same time, but, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and "in what concerns the sex," as he said in his jargon--a downright, unmitigated lout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was. Later on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, began to grow gray, when the Magaera began to be developed from the Pamela, the female Thenardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who had dabbled in stupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with impunity. The result was that her eldest daughter was named Eponine; as for the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare; I know not to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.</P>

    However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom. It is not rare for the neatherd's boy nowadays to bear the name of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte--if there are still any vicomtes--to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques. This displacement, which places the "elegant" name on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of equality. The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else. Beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing,-- the French Revolution.</P>

    那只被逮住的老鼠是瘦的，但是猫儿，即使得了一只瘦老鼠，也要快乐一场。</P>

    那德纳第夫妇是什么东西呢？</P>

    我们现在简单地谈谈。将来再补充描绘他们的轮廓。</P>

    这些人属于那种爬上去了的粗鄙人和失败了的聪明人所组成的混杂阶级，这种混杂阶级处于所谓中等阶级和所谓下层阶级之间，下层阶级的某些弱点和中等阶级的绝大部分恶习它都兼而有之，既没有工人的那种大公无私的热情，也没有资产阶级的那种诚实的信条。</P>

    这些小人，一旦受到恶毒的煽动就很容易变成凶恶的力量。那妇人就具有做恶婆的本质，那男子也是个无赖的材料。他们俩都有那种向罪恶方面猛烈发展的极大可能性。世上有一种人就象虾似的不断退向黑暗，他们一生中只后退，不前进，并且利用经验，增加他们的丑恶，不停地日益败坏下去，心地也日益狠毒起来。这一对男女，便是那种东西。</P>

    尤其是那德纳第汉子，他可以使观察他的人感到局促不安。我们对某些人只须望一眼便起戒惧之心，我们觉得他们在两方面都是阴森森的，在人后，他们惶惶终日，在人前，他们声势凶狠。他们的心，从不告人。我们无从知道他们曾干过什么，也无从知道他们将干些什么。他们目光中的那种遮遮掩掩的神情才会把他们揭露出来。我们只须观察他们的一言一行便可想见他们过去生活中一些见不得人的隐事和未来生活中一些阴谋鬼计。</P>

    这个德纳第，如果我们相信他自己说的话，是当过兵的；据他自己说，他当过中士；他大致参加过一八一五年的那次战役①，据说还表现得相当勇敢。将来我们就会知道他究竟是怎样的一个人。在他酒店的招牌上描绘了他在作战中的一次亲身经历。那是他自己画的，因为他什么都会干一点，但都干不好。 </P>

    ①指滑铁卢战役。</P>

    当时的古典主义旧小说，在《克雷荔》以后就只有《洛多伊斯卡》，那些书都还高尚，但越往后越庸俗，从斯居德黎小姐降至布隆－麻拉姆夫人，从拉法耶特夫人降至巴德勒米－哈陀夫人，那一类小说都把巴黎那些看门女人的情火点燃了，甚至连累郊区。德纳弟妈妈恰有足够的聪明能读那一类书籍。她寝馈其中，把自己微弱的脑力沉浸在那里，因此，在她很年轻时，甚至在年龄稍大时，她在她丈夫身旁总显得心事重重似的。她丈夫是一个深沉的滑头，不务正业，略通文法，既粗鄙又精明，在言情小说方面他爱读比戈－勒白朗的作品，“在性的问题上”（这是他的口头禅），他却是个正经的鲁男子，从不乱来。他妻子的年龄比他小十二到十五岁。后来，当浪漫的堕马髻渐成白发，佳人转为丑妇，德纳第太太便成为一个肥胖、恶劣、尝过一些下流小说滋味的妇人了。读坏书的人总免不了坏影响。结果，她的大女儿叫做爱潘妮。至于小女儿，那可怜的孩子，几乎叫做菊纳尔，幸而狄克莱－狄弥尼尔的一部小说，倒莫名其妙的救了她，她只叫做阿兹玛。</P>

    此外，我们还顺便提一下，我们现在谈到的那个怪时代，在替孩子们取小名方面固然混乱，但也不见得事事都浅薄可笑。在我们刚才指出的那种浪漫因素以外，也还有一种社会影响。目前，平民的孩子叫做阿瑟、亚福莱或阿尔封斯，子爵（假使还有子爵的话）叫做托马、皮埃尔或雅克，那都不是什么稀罕的事。“高雅”的名字移到平民身上，村野的名字移到贵人身上，那样的交流只能说是平等思想激荡的后果。新思潮深入一切，无可阻挡，孩子命名的情形，便是一例。在这种混乱现象的后面存在一种伟大深刻的东西，那就是法兰西革命。</P>

 Part 1 Book 4 Chapter 3 The Lark

    It is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper. The cook-shop was in a bad way.</P>

    Thanks to the traveller's fifty-seven francs, Thenardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month they were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette's outfit to Paris, and pawned it at the pawnbroker's for sixty francs. As soon as that sum was spent, the Thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity; and they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thenardier brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the rest had left--a little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat. Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions; Cosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to theirs.</P>

    The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M. sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter every month, that she might have news of her child. The Thenardiers replied invariably, "Cosette is doing wonderfully well."</P>

    At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month. The year was not completed when Thenardier said: "A fine favor she is doing us, in sooth! What does she expect us to do with her seven francs?" and he wrote to demand twelve francs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy, "and was coming on well," submitted, and forwarded the twelve francs.</P>

    Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other. Mother Thenardier loved her two daughters passionately, which caused her to hate the stranger.</P>

    It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own, and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many women of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is certain that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received the whole of it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble being, who should not have understood anything of this world or of God, incessantly punished, scolded, ill-used, beaten, and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself, who lived in a ray of dawn!</P>

    Madame Thenardier was vicious with Cosette. Eponine and Azelma were vicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. The size is smaller; that is all.</P>

    A year passed; then another.</P>

    People in the village said:--</P>

    "Those Thenardiers are good people. They are not rich, and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!"</P>

    They thought that Cosette's mother had forgotten her.</P>

    In the meanwhile, Thenardier, having learned, it is impossible to say by what obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that the mother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month, saying that "the creature" was growing and "eating," and threatening to send her away. "Let her not bother me," he exclaimed, "or I'll fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets. I must have an increase." The mother paid the fifteen francs.</P>

    From year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.</P>

    As long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two other children; as soon as she began to develop a little, that is to say, before she was even five years old, she became the servant of the household.</P>

    Five years old! the reader will say; that is not probable. Alas! it is true. Social suffering begins at all ages. Have we not recently seen the trial of a man named Dumollard, an orphan turned bandit, who, from the age of five, as the official documents state, being alone in the world, "worked for his living and stole"?</P>

    Cosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard, the street, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Thenardiers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner, since the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular in her payments. Some months she was in arrears.</P>

    If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three years, she would not have recognized her child. Cosette, so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house, was now thin and pale. She had an indescribably uneasy look. "The sly creature," said the Thenardiers.</P>

    Injustice had made her peevish, and misery had made her ugly. Nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes, which inspired pain, because, large as they were, it seemed as though one beheld in them a still larger amount of sadness.</P>

    It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six years old, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes, sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands, and a tear in her great eyes.</P>

    She was called the Lark in the neighborhood. The populace, who are fond of these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling, frightened, and shivering little creature, no bigger than a bird, who was awake every morning before any one else in the house or the village, and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak.</P>

    Only the little lark never sang.</P>

    一味狠毒，不能发达。那客店的光景并不好。</P>

    幸而有那女客的五十七个法郎，德纳第得免于官厅的追究，他出的期票也保持了信用。下一个月他仍旧缺钱，那妇人便把珂赛特的衣服饰物带到巴黎，向当店押了六十法郎。那笔款子用完以后，德纳第夫妇便立刻认为他们带那孩子是在救济别人，因此那孩子在他家里经常受到被救济者的待遇。她的衣服被典光以后，他们便叫她穿德纳第家小姑娘的旧裙和旧衫，就是说，破裙和破衫。他们把大家吃剩的东西给她吃，她吃得比狗好一些，比猫又差一些，并且猫和狗还经常是她的同餐者；珂赛特用一只木盆，和猫狗的木盆一样，和猫狗一同在桌子底下吃。</P>

    她的母亲在滨海蒙特勒伊住下来了，我们以后还会谈到的，她每月写信，应当说，她每月请人写信探问她孩子的消息。</P>

    德纳第夫妇千篇一律地回复说：“珂赛特安好异常。”</P>

    最初六个月满了以后，她母亲把第七个月的七个法郎寄去，并且月月都按期寄去，相当准时。一年还不到，德纳第汉子便说：“她给了我们多大的面子！她要我们拿她这七个法郎干什么？”于是他写信硬要十二法郎。他们向这位母亲说她的孩子快乐平安，母亲曲意迁就，照寄了十二法郎。</P>

    某些人不能只爱一面而不恨其他一面。德纳第婆子酷爱她自己的两个女儿，因而也厌恶那外来的孩子。一个慈母的爱会有它丑恶的一面，想来真使人失望。珂赛特在她家里尽管只占一点点地方，她仍觉得她夺了她家里人的享受，仿佛那孩子把她两个小女儿呼吸的空气也减少了一样。那妇人，和许多和她同一类型的妇人一样，每天都有一定数量的抚爱和一定数量的打骂要发泄。假使她没有珂赛特，她那两个女儿，尽管百般宠爱，一定也还是要受尽她的打骂的。但是那个外来的女孩做了她们的替身，代受了打骂。她自己的两个女儿却只消受她的爱抚。珂赛特的一举一动都会受到一阵冰雹似的殴打，凶横无理之极。一个柔和、幼弱、还一点也不了解人生和上帝是什么的孩子，却无时不受惩罚、辱骂、虐待、殴打，还得瞧着那两个和她一样的女孩儿享受她们孩提时期的幸福！</P>

    德纳第婆子既狠心，爱潘妮和阿兹玛便也狠心。孩子们，在那种小小年纪总是母亲的再版。版本的大小有所不同而已。</P>

    一年过了，又是一年。</P>

    那村子里的人说：</P>

    “德纳第一家子都是好人。他们并不宽裕，却还抚养人家丢在他们家里的一个穷孩子！”</P>

    大家都认为珂赛特已被她的母亲忘记了。</P>

    同时，那德纳第汉子不知从什么密报中探听到那孩子大致是私生的，母亲不便承认，于是他硬敲每月十五法郎，说那“畜生”长大了，“要东西吃”，并且以送还孩子来要挟。“她敢不听我的话！”他吼道，“我也不管她瞒人不瞒人，把孩子送还给她就是。非加我的钱不行。”那母亲照寄十五法郎。</P>

    年复一年，孩子长大了，她的苦难也增加了。</P>

    珂赛特在极小时，一向是代那两个孩子受罪的替身；当她的身体刚长大一点，就是说连五岁还没有到的时候，她又成了这家人的仆人。</P>

    五岁，也许有人说，那不见得确有其事吧。唉！确有其事。人类社会的痛苦的起始是不限年齿的。最近我们不是见过杜美拉的案子，一个孤儿，当了土匪，据官厅的文件说，他从五岁起，便独自一人在世上“作工餬口，从事盗窃”吗？</P>

    他们叫珂赛特办杂事，打扫房间、院子、街道，洗杯盘碗盏，甚至搬运重东西。她的母亲一向住在滨海蒙特勒伊，德纳第夫妇见到她近来寄钱没有从前那样准时了，便更加觉得有理由那样对待孩子。有几个月没有寄钱来了。</P>

    假使那母亲在那第三年的年末来到孟费郿，她一定会不认识她的孩子了。珂赛特，当她到这一家的时候，是那样美丽，那样红润，现在是又黄又瘦。她的举动，也不知道为什么会那样缩手缩脚。德纳第夫妇老说她“鬼头鬼脑”！</P>

    待遇的不平使她性躁，生活的艰苦使她变丑。她只还保有那双秀丽的眼睛，使人见了格外难受，因为她的眼睛是那么大，看去就仿佛那里的愁苦也格外多。</P>

    冬天，看见这个还不到六岁的可怜的孩子衣衫褴褛，在寒气中战栗，天还没亮，便拿着一把大扫帚，用她的小红手紧紧握着它打扫街道，一滴泪珠挂在她那双大眼睛的边上，好不叫人痛心。</P>

    在那里，大家叫她百灵鸟。那小妞儿原不比小鸟大多少，并且老是哆哆嗦嗦，凡事都使她惊慌，战栗，每天早晨在那一家和那一村里老是第一个醒来，不到天亮，便已到了街上或田里，一般爱用比喻的人便替她取了这个名字。</P>

    不过这只百灵鸟从来不歌唱。</P>

 Part 1 Book 5 Chapter 1 The History of a Progress in Black Glass Trinkets

    And in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according to the people at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? Where was she? What was she doing?</P>

    After leaving her little Cosette with the Thenardiers, she had continued her journey, and had reached M. sur M.</P>

    This, it will be remembered, was in 1818.</P>

    Fantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. Had changed its aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness, her native town had prospered.</P>

    About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place.</P>

    This detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it at length; we should almost say, to underline it.</P>

    From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry the imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. This industry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw material, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine returned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place in the production of "black goods." Towards the close of 1815 a man, a stranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspired with the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin, and, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laid together, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.</P>

    This very small change had effected a revolution.</P>

    This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to raise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second place, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the third place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which was a benefit to the manufacturer.</P>

    Thus three results ensued from one idea.</P>

    In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich, which is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better. He was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known; of the beginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he had come to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.</P>

    It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn his own fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.</P>

    On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance, and the language of a workingman.</P>

    It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening, knapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken out in the town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at the risk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport. Afterwards they had learned his name. He was called Father Madeleine.</P>

    ①这是一种以玻璃原料制造假玉、假钻石、假珍珠及其他女用饰品的工厂。</P>

    成什么样了？她在什么地方？干什么事呢？</P>

    把她的小珂赛特交给德纳第夫妇以后，她继续赶路，到了滨海蒙特勒伊。</P>

    我们记得，那是一八一八年。</P>

    芳汀离开她的故乡已有十年光景。滨海蒙特勒伊的情形早已变了。正当芳汀从一次苦难陷入另一次苦难时，她的故乡却兴盛起来了。</P>

    两年以来，一种轻工业在那里发展起来了，那是小地方的大事情。</P>

    这些细节关系很大，我们认为值得把它叙述出来。我们几乎要说，把它当作重点叙述出来。</P>

    从一个不可考的时代起，滨海蒙特勒伊就有一种仿造英国黑玉和德国烧料的特别工业。那种工业素来不发达，因为原料贵，影响到工资。正当芳汀回到滨海蒙特勒伊时，那种“烧料细工品”的生产已经进行了一种空前的改革。一八一五年年底有一个人，一个大家不认识的人，来住在这城里，他想到在制造中用漆胶代替松胶，特别在手镯方面，他在做底圈时，采用只把两头靠拢的方法代替那种两头连接焊死的方法。这一点极小的改革就起了很大的作用。</P>

    那一点极小的改革确实大大降低了原料的成本，因此，首先工资可以增高，一乡都得到了实惠；第二，制造有了改进，消费者得了好处；第三，售价可以降低，利润加了三信，厂主也得到利润。</P>

    因此，从一个办法得出三种结果。</P>

    不到三年功夫，发明这方法的人成了大富翁，那当然很好，更大的好处是他四周的人也发了财。他不是本省的人。关于他的籍贯，大众全不知道，他的往事，知道的人也不多。</P>

    据说他来到这城里时只有很少的钱，至多不过几百法郎。</P>

    他利用这一点微薄的资本来实现他精心研究出来的那种巧妙方法，他自己获得了实惠，全乡也获得了实惠。</P>

    他初到滨海蒙特勒伊时，他的服装、举动和谈吐都象一个工人。</P>

    好象在一个十二月的黄昏，他背上背个口装，手里拿根带刺的棍，摸进这滨海蒙特勒伊小城时，正遇到区公所失火。他曾跳到火里，不顾生命危险，救出两个小孩，那两个小孩恰是警察队长的儿子，因此大家都没有想到验他的护照。从那一天起，大家都知道了他的名字，他叫马德兰伯伯。</P>

 Part 1 Book 5 Chapter 2 Madeleine

    He was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, and who was good. That was all that could be said about him.</P>

    Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably re-constructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade. Spain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchases there each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this branch of commerce. Father Madeleine's profits were such, that at the end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in which there were two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other for women. Any one who was hungry could present himself there, and was sure of finding employment and bread. Father Madeleine required of the men good will, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had separated the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that the women and girls might remain discreet. On this point he was inflexible. It was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant. He was all the more firmly set on this severity, since M. sur M., being a garrison town, opportunities for corruption abounded. However, his coming had been a boon, and his presence was a godsend. Before Father Madeleine's arrival, everything had languished in the country; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil. A strong circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere. Slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown. There was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it; no dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it.</P>

    Father Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted but one thing: Be an honest man. Be an honest woman.</P>

    As we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause and the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thing in a simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were his chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little of himself. In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte; but before reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs, he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor.</P>

    The hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. Sur M. is divided into the upper and the lower town. The lower town, in which he lived, had but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling to ruin: he constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys. He allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary, and one day he said to some one who expressed surprise, "The two prime functionaries of the state are the nurse and the schoolmaster." He created at his own expense an infant school, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a fund for aiding old and infirm workmen. As his factory was a centre, a new quarter, in which there were a good many indigent families, rose rapidly around him; he established there a free dispensary.</P>

    At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, "He's a jolly fellow who means to get rich." When they saw him enriching the country before he enriched himself, the good souls said, "He is an ambitious man." This seemed all the more probable since the man was religious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch. He went regularly to low mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalry everywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the religious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name of Fouche, Duc d'Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. He indulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors. But when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock, he perceived in him a possible candidate, and resolved to outdo him; he took a Jesuit confessor, and went to high mass and to vespers. Ambition was at that time, in the direct acceptation of the word, a race to the steeple. The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God, for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital, which made twelve.</P>

    Nevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town to the effect that, on the representations of the prefect and in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country, Father Madeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. Sur M. Those who had pronounced this new-comer to be "an ambitious fellow," seized with delight on this opportunity which all men desire, to exclaim, "There! what did we say!" All M. sur M. was in an uproar. The rumor was well founded. Several days later the appointment appeared in the Moniteur. On the following day Father Madeleine refused.</P>

    In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by Madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury made their report, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion of Honor. A fresh excitement in the little town. Well, so it was the cross that he wanted! Father Madeleine refused the cross.</P>

    Decidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of their predicament by saying, "After all, he is some sort of an adventurer."</P>

    We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed him everything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him. His workmen, in particular, adored him, and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity. When he was known to be rich, "people in society" bowed to him, and he received invitations in the town; he was called, in town, Monsieur Madeleine; his workmen and the children continued to call him Father Madeleine, and that was what was most adapted to make him smile. In proportion as he mounted, throve, invitations rained down upon him. "Society" claimed him for its own. The prim little drawing-rooms on M. sur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan, opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire. They made a thousand advances to him. He refused.</P>

    This time the good gossips had no trouble. "He is an ignorant man, of no education. No one knows where he came from. He would not know how to behave in society. It has not been absolutely proved that he knows how to read."</P>

    When they saw him making money, they said, "He is a man of business." When they saw him scattering his money about, they said, "He is an ambitious man." When he was seen to decline honors, they said, "He is an adventurer." When they saw him repulse society, they said, "He is a brute."</P>

    In 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion of the whole country round about was so unanimous, that the King again appointed him mayor of the town. He again declined; but the prefect resisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implore him, the people in the street besought him; the urging was so vigorous that he ended by accepting. It was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people, who called to him from her threshold, in an angry way: "A good mayor is a useful thing. Is he drawing back before the good which he can do?"</P>

    This was the third phase of his ascent. Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine. Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire.</P>

    他是个五十左右的人，神色忧虑而性情和好。我们能说的只是这一点。</P>

    由于那种工业经过他的巧妙改造，获得了迅速的发展，滨海蒙特勒伊便成了一个重要的企业中心。销售大量烧料细工品的西班牙每年都到这里来定购大宗产品。滨海蒙特勒伊在这种贸易上几乎和伦敦、柏林处于竞争地位。马德兰伯伯获得了大宗利润，因而能在第二年建造一幢高大的厂房，厂里分两个大车间，一个男车间，一个女车间。任何一个无衣食的人都可以到那里去报名，准有工作和面包。马德兰伯伯要求男工应有毅力，女工应有好作风，无论男女都应当贞洁。他把男女工人分在两个车间，目的是要让姑娘们和妇女们都能安心工作。在这一点上他的态度是一点不动摇的。这是他唯一无可通融的地方。正因为滨海蒙特勒伊是一个驻扎军队的城市，腐化堕落的机会多，他有足够的理由提出这种要求。况且他的来到是件好事，他的出现也是种天意。在马德兰伯伯来到这里以前，地方上的各种事业都是萧条的，现在呢，大家都靠健康的劳动生活。欣欣向荣的气象广被一乡，渗透一切。失业和苦难都已消灭。在这一乡已没有一个空到一文钱也没有的衣袋，也没有一个苦到一点欢乐也没有的人家。</P>

    马德兰伯伯雇用所有的人，他只坚持一点：做诚实的男子！做诚实的姑娘！</P>

    我们已经说过，马德兰伯伯是这种活动的动力和中枢，他在这一活动中获得他的财富，但是，这仿佛不是他的主要目的，一个简单的商人能这样，是件相当奇特的事。仿佛他为别人想的地方多，为自己想的地方少。一八二○年，大家知道他有一笔六十三万法郎的款子用他个人名义存放在拉菲特①银行里；但是在他为自己留下这六十三万法郎以前，他已为这座城市和穷人用去了一百多万。 </P>

    ①拉菲特（Laffitte，1767-1844），法国大银行家和政治活动家，奥尔良党人，金融资产阶级代表，政府首脑（1830?831）。他所开设的银行叫拉菲特银行。</P>

    医院的经费原是不充裕的，他在那里设了十个床位。滨海蒙特勒伊分上下两城，他住的下城只有一个小学校，校舍已经破败，他起造了两幢，一幢为男孩，一幢为女孩。他拿出自己的钱，津贴两个教员，这项津贴竟比他们微薄的薪金多出两倍；一天，他对一个对这件事表示惊讶的人说：“政府最重要的两种公务员，便是乳母和小学教师。”他又用自己的钱创设了一所贫儿院，这种措施当时在法国还几乎是创举，他又为年老和残废的工人创办了救济金。他的工厂成了一个中心，在厂址附近原有许多一贫如洗的人家，到后来，在那一带却出现了一个崭新的区域。他在那里开设了一所免费药房。</P>

    最初，他开始那样做时，有些头脑单纯的人都说：“这是个财迷。”过后，别人看见他在替自己找钱以前却先繁荣地方，那几个头脑单纯的人又说：“这是个野心家。”那种看法好象很对头，因为他信宗教，并且在一定程度上还遵守教规，这在当时是很受人尊敬的。每逢礼拜日，他必按时去参加一次普通弥撒。当地的那位议员，平日一向随时随地留意是否有人和他竞争，因而他立刻对那种宗教信仰起了戒心。那议员在帝国时代当过立法院的成员，他的宗教思想，和一个叫富歇①的经堂神甫（奥特朗托公爵）的思想是一样的。他是那神甫提拔的人，也是他的朋友。他常在人后偷偷嘲笑上帝。但是当他看见这位有钱的工厂主马德兰去做七点钟的普通弥撒时，就仿佛见了一个可能做议员候选人的人，便下定决心要赛过他，于是他供奉一个耶稣会教士做他的忏悔教士，还去做大弥撒和晚祷。野心在当时完全是一种钟楼赛跑②。穷人和慈悲的上帝都受到他们那种恐慌的实惠，因为那位光荣的议员也设了两个床位，一共成了十二个。 </P>

    ①富歇（Fouché，1759-1820），国民公会代表，曾参与颠覆罗伯斯庇尔，继又帮助拿破仑政变，任帝国政府的警务大臣，受封为公爵。拿破仑失败后投降复辟王朝。</P>

    ②钟楼赛跑是一种以钟楼为目标的越野赛跑。</P>

    但是在一八一九年的一天早晨，城里忽然有人说马德兰伯伯由于省长先生的保荐和他在地方上所起的积极作用，不久就会由国王任命为滨海蒙特勒伊市长了。从前说过这新来的人是“野心家”的那些人听到这个符合大家愿望的消息时，也抓住机会，得意洋洋地喊道：“是吧！我们曾说过什么的吧？”整个滨海蒙特勒伊都轰动了。这消息原来是真的。几天过后，委任令在《通报》上刊出来了。第二天，马德兰伯伯推辞不受。</P>

    还是在这一八一九年，用马德兰发明的方法制造出来的产品在工业展览会里陈列出来了，通过评奖委员的报告，国王以荣誉勋章授予这位发明家。在那小城里又有过一番新的轰动。“呵！他要的原来是十字勋章！”马德兰伯伯又推辞了十字勋章。</P>

    这人真是个谜。头脑单纯的人，无可奈何，只得说：“总而言之，这是个想往上爬的家伙。”</P>

    我们把这人看清楚了，地方受到他许多好处，穷人更是完全依靠他；他是一个那样有用的人，结果大家非尊敬他不可；他又是一个那样和蔼可亲的人，结果大家非爱他不可；尤其是他的那些工人特别爱他，他却用一种郁郁寡欢的庄重态度接受那种敬爱。当他被证实是富翁时，一般“社会贤达”都向他致敬，在城里，大家还称他为马德兰先生，他的那些工人和一般孩子却仍叫他马德兰伯伯，那是一件使他最高兴的事。他的地位越来越高，请帖也就雨一般地落在他的头上了。“社会”要他。滨海蒙特勒伊的那些装腔作势的小客厅的门，当初在他还是个手艺工人时，当然是对他关着的，现在对这位百万富翁，却大开特开了。他们千方百计地笼络他。但他却不为所动。</P>

    但这样仍堵不住那些头脑单纯的人的嘴。“那是个无知识的人，一个没受过高尚教育的人。大家都还不知道他是从什么地方钻出来的呢。他不知道在交际场中应当怎么办。他究竟识字不识字，也还没有证明。”</P>

    当初别人看见他赚了钱，就说他是“商人”；看见他施舍他的钱，又说他是“野心家”；看见他推谢光荣，说他是个“投机的家伙”；现在，他谢绝社交，大家说：“那是个莽汉。”</P>

    一八二○年，是他到滨海蒙特勒伊的第五年，他在那地方所起的积极作用是那样显著，当地人民的期望是那样一致，以致国王又派他做那地方的市长。他仍旧推辞，但是省长不许他推辞，所有的重要人物也都来劝驾，人民群集街头向他请愿，敦促的情况太热烈了，他只好接受。有人注意到当时使他作出决定的最大力量，是人民中一个老妇人所说的一句气愤话。她当时立在他门口，几乎怒不可遏，对他喊道：“一个好市长，就是一个有用的人。在能办好事时难道可以退却吗？”</P>

    这是他上升的第三阶段。马德兰伯伯早已变成马德兰先生。马德兰先生现在又成为市长先生了。</P>

 Part 1 Book 5 Chapter 3 Sums deposited with Laffitte

    On the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. He had gray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, the thoughtful visage of a philosopher. He habitually wore a hat with a wide brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. He fulfilled his duties as mayor; but, with that exception, he lived in solitude. He spoke to but few people. He avoided polite attentions; he escaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling, The women said of him, "What a good-natured bear!" His pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields.</P>

    He always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, which he read. He had a well-selected little library. He loved books; books are cold but safe friends. In proportion as leisure came to him with fortune, he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind. It had been observed that, ever since his arrival at M. sur M.. his language had grown more polished, more choice, and more gentle with every passing year. He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls, but he rarely made use of it. When he did happen to do so, his shooting was something so infallible as to inspire terror. He never killed an inoffensive animal. He never shot at a little bird.</P>

    Although he was no longer young, it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was in need of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, or stopped a runaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets full of money when he went out; but they were empty on his return. When he passed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats.</P>

    It was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life, since he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to the peasants. He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of common salt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in bloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the grass and in the houses.</P>

    He had "recipes" for exterminating from a field, blight, tares, foxtail, and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. He defended a rabbit warren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which he placed in it.</P>

    One day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles; he examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried, and said: "They are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf makes an excellent vegetable; when it is older, it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax. Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth. Chopped up, nettles are good for poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle. The seed of the nettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair of animals; the root, mixed with salt, produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter. Moreover, it is an excellent hay, which can be cut twice. And what is required for the nettle? A little soil, no care, no culture. Only the seed falls as it is ripe, and it is difficult to collect it. That is all. With the exercise of a little care, the nettle could be made useful; it is neglected and it becomes hurtful. It is exterminated. How many men resemble the nettle!" He added, after a pause: "Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators."</P>

    The children loved him because he knew how to make charming little trifles of straw and cocoanuts.</P>

    When he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood and the grief of others attracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled with the friends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, with the priests groaning around a coffin. He seemed to like to give to his thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of the other world. With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with a sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sad voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death.</P>

    He performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in them as a man conceals himself because of evil actions. He penetrated houses privately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively. A poor wretch on returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened, sometimes even forced, during his absence. The poor man made a clamor over it: some malefactor had been there! He entered, and the first thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of furniture. The "malefactor" who had been there was Father Madeleine.</P>

    He was affable and sad. The people said: "There is a rich man who has not a haughty air. There is a happy man who has not a contented air."</P>

    Some people maintained that he was a mysterious person, and that no one ever entered his chamber, which was a regular anchorite's cell, furnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and skulls of dead men! This was much talked of, so that one of the elegant and malicious young women of M. sur M. came to him one day, and asked: "Monsieur le Maire, pray show us your chamber. It is said to be a grotto." He smiled, and introduced them instantly into this "grotto." They were well punished for their curiosity. The room was very simply furnished in mahogany, which was rather ugly, like all furniture of that sort, and hung with paper worth twelve sous. They could see nothing remarkable about it, except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver, "for they were hall-marked," an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns.</P>

    Nevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into the room, and that it was a hermit's cave, a mysterious retreat, a hole, a tomb.</P>

    It was also whispered about that he had "immense" sums deposited with Laffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at his immediate disposal, so that, it was added, M. Madeleine could make his appearance at Laffitte's any morning, sign a receipt, and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes. In reality, "these two or three millions" were reducible, as we have said, to six hundred and thirty or forty thousand francs.</P>

    可是，他的生活还是和当初一样朴素。他有灰白头发，严肃的目光，面色焦黑，象个工人，精神沉郁，象个哲学家。他经常戴一顶宽边帽，穿一身粗呢长礼服，一直扣到颔下。他执行他的市长职务，下班以后便闭门深居。他经常只和少数几个人谈话，他逃避寒喧，遇见人，从侧面行个礼便连忙趋避；他用微笑来避免交谈，用布施来避免微笑。妇人们都说他是“一只多么乖的熊①！”他的消遣方法便是到田野里去散步。 </P>

    ①法国人说“熊”，是指性情孤僻的人。</P>

    他老是一个人吃饭，面前摊开一本书，从事阅读。他有一个精致的小书柜。他爱书籍，书籍是一种冷静可靠的朋友。他有了钱，闲空时间也随着增加了，他好象是利用这些时间来提高自己的修养。自从他来到滨海蒙特勒伊以后，大家觉得他的谈吐一年比一年来得更谦恭、更考究、更文雅了。</P>

    他散步时喜欢带一枝长枪，但不常用。偶开一枪，却从无虚发，使人惊叹。他从不打死一只无害的野兽，他从不射击一只小鸟。</P>

    他虽已上了年纪，不过据说体力仍是不可思议。他常在必要时予人一臂之助，扶起一匹马，推动一个陷在泥坑里的车轮，握着两只角去拦阻一头逃跑的牡牛。出门时，他的衣袋中总是装满了钱，到回来，又都空了。他从一个村庄经过时，那些衣服破烂的孩子们都欢天喜地跑到他身边，就象一群小飞虫似的围着他。</P>

    大家猜想他从前大约过过田野生活，因为他有各种有用的秘诀教给那些农民。他告诉他们用普通盐水喷洒仓屋并冲洗地板缝，就可以消灭蛀麦子的飞娥，在墙上、屋顶上、合壁里、屋子里，处处挂上开着花的奥维奥草，就可以驱除米蛀虫。他有许多方法剔除所有一切寄生在田里伤害麦子的草，如野鸠豆草、黑穗草、鸠豆草、山涧草、狐尾草等。他在兔子窝里放一只巴巴利①小猪，它的臭味就可使耗子不敢来伤害兔子。 </P>

    ①巴巴利（Baibarie），非洲北部一带的统称。</P>

    一天，他看见村里有许多人正忙着拔除荨麻。他望着一堆已经拔出并且枯萎了的荨麻说道：“死了。假使我们知道利用它，这却是一种好东西。荨麻在嫩时，叶子是一种非常好吃的蔬菜。老荨麻也有一种和亚麻或苎麻一样的纤维和经络。荨麻布并不比苎麻布差些。荨麻斩碎了可以喂鸡鸭。磨烂了也可以喂牛羊。荨麻子拌在刍秣里能使动物的毛光润，根拌在盐里可制成一种悦目的黄色颜料。不管怎样，这总是一种可以收割两次的草料。并且荨麻需要什么呢？一点点土，不需要照顾，不需要培养。不过它的籽，一面熟，一面落，不容易收获罢了。我们只须费一点点力，荨麻就成了有用的东西，我们不去管它，它就成了有害的东西了。于是我们铲除它。世上有多少人就和荨麻大同小异。”他沉默了一会，又接下去说：“我的朋友们，记牢这一点，世界上没有坏草，也没有坏人，只有坏的庄稼人。”</P>

    孩子们爱他，也还因为他知道用麦秸和椰子壳做成各种有趣的小玩意儿。</P>

    他一看见天主堂门口布置成黑色，总走进去。他探访丧礼，正如别人探访洗礼。由于他的性格非常温和，别人丧偶和其他不幸的事都是他所关心的。他常和居丧的朋友、守制的家庭、在柩旁叹息的神甫们混在一处。他仿佛乐于把自己的思想沉浸在那种满含乐土景色的诔歌里。眼睛仰望天空，仿佛在对无极中那些神秘发出心愿，他静听在死亡的深渊边唱出的那种酸楚的歌声。</P>

    他秘密地做了许多善事，正如别人秘密地干着坏事一样。晚上，他常乘人不备，走到别人家里，偷偷摸摸地爬上楼梯。一个穷鬼回到他破屋子里，发现他的房门已被人趁他不在时开过了，有时甚至是撬开的。那穷人连声喊道：“有个小偷来过了！”他走进去，他发现的第一件东西，便是丢在家具上的一枚金币。来过的那个“小偷”正是马德兰伯伯。</P>

    他为人和蔼而忧郁。一般平民常说：“这才是一个有钱而不骄傲的人，这才是一个幸福而不自满的人。”</P>

    有些人还认为他是一个神秘的人，他们硬说别人从来没有进过他的房间，因为他那房间是一间真正的隐修士的密室，里面放着一个有翅膀的沙漏，还装饰着两根交叉放着的死人的股骨和几个骷髅头。这种话传得很广，因而有一天，滨海蒙特勒伊的几个调皮的时髦青年女子来到他家里，向他提出要求：“市长先生，请您把您的房间给我们看看。人家说它是个石洞。”他微微笑了一下，立刻引她们到“石洞”去。她们大失所望。那仅仅是一间陈设着相当难看的桃花心木家具的房间，那种家具总是难看的，墙上裱着值十二个苏一张的纸。除开壁炉上两个旧烛台外，其余的东西都是不值她们一看的，那两个烛台好象是银的，“因为上面有官厅的戳记。”这是种小城市风味十足的见识。</P>

    往后，大家仍旧照样传说从没有人到过他那屋子，说那是一个隐士居住的岩穴，一种梦游的地方，一个土洞，一座坟。</P>

    大家还叽叽喳喳地说他有“大宗”款子存在拉菲特银行，并且还有这样一个特点，就是他随时都可以立刻提取那些存款，他们还补充说，马德兰先生可能会在一个早晨跑到拉菲特银行，签上一张收据，十分钟之内提走他的两三百万法郎。而实际上，我们已经说过，那“两三百万”已经渐渐减到六十三四万了。</P>

 Part 1 Book 5 Chapter 4 M. Madeleine in Mourning

    At the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M. Myriel, Bishop of D----, surnamed "Monseigneur Bienvenu," who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.</P>

    The Bishop of D---- --to supply here a detail which the papers omitted-- had been blind for many years before his death, and content to be blind, as his sister was beside him.</P>

    Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in fact, one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth, where nothing is complete. To have continually at one's side a woman, a daughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because you need her and because she cannot do without you; to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us; to be able to incessantly measure one's affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us, and to say to ourselves, "Since she consecrates the whole of her time to me, it is because I possess the whole of her heart"; to behold her thought in lieu of her face; to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world; to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound of wings; to hear her come and go, retire, speak, return, sing, and to think that one is the centre of these steps, of this speech; to manifest at each instant one's personal attraction; to feel one's self all the more powerful because of one's infirmity; to become in one's obscurity, and through one's obscurity, the star around which this angel gravitates,--few felicities equal this. The supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved; loved for one's own sake--let us say rather, loved in spite of one's self; this conviction the blind man possesses. To be served in distress is to be caressed. Does he lack anything? No. One does not lose the sight when one has love. And what love! A love wholly constituted of virtue! There is no blindness where there is certainty. Soul seeks soul, gropingly, and finds it. And this soul, found and tested, is a woman. A hand sustains you; it is hers: a mouth lightly touches your brow; it is her mouth: you hear a breath very near you; it is hers. To have everything of her, from her worship to her pity, never to be left, to have that sweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon that immovable reed, to touch Providence with one's hands, and to be able to take it in one's arms,--God made tangible,--what bliss! The heart, that obscure, celestial flower, undergoes a mysterious blossoming. One would not exchange that shadow for all brightness! The angel soul is there, uninterruptedly there; if she departs, it is but to return again; she vanishes like a dream, and reappears like reality. One feels warmth approaching, and behold! she is there. One overflows with serenity, with gayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night. And there are a thousand little cares. Nothings, which are enormous in that void. The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you, and supplying the vanished universe to you. One is caressed with the soul. One sees nothing, but one feels that one is adored. It is a paradise of shadows.</P>

    It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to the other.</P>

    The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M. sur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in black, and with crape on his hat.</P>

    This mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on. It seemed to throw a light on M. Madeleine's origin. It was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop. "He has gone into mourning for the Bishop of D----" said the drawing-rooms; this raised M. Madeleine's credit greatly, and procured for him, instantly and at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble world of M. sur M. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditated raising the quarantine against M. Madeleine, the probable relative of a bishop. M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained, by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones. One evening, a ruler in that petty great world, who was curious by right of seniority, ventured to ask him, "M. le Maire is doubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D----?"</P>

    He said, "No, Madame."</P>

    "But," resumed the dowager, "you are wearing mourning for him."</P>

    He replied, "It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth."</P>

    Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that he encountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned, inquired his name, and gave him money. The little Savoyards told each other about it: a great many of them passed that way.</P>

    一八二一年初，各地报纸都刊出了迪涅主教，“别号卞福汝大人”，米里哀先生逝世的消息。他是在八十二岁的高龄入圣的。</P>

    我们在此地补充各地报纸略去的一点。迪涅主教在去世以前几年双目已经失明，但是他以失明为乐，因为他有妹子在他身旁。</P>

    让我们顺便说一句，双目失明，并且为人所爱，在这一事事都不圆满的世界上，那可算是一种甘美得出奇的人生幸福。在你的身旁，经常有个和你相依为命的妇人、姑娘、姊妹、可爱的人儿，知道自己对她是决不可少的，而她对自己也是非有不可的，能经常在她和你相处时间的长短上去推测她的感情，并且能向自己说：“她既然把她的全部时间用在我身上，就足以说明我占有了她整个的心”；不能看见她的面目，但能了解她的思想；在与世隔绝的生活中，体会到一个人儿的忠实；感到衣裙的摇曳，如同小鸟振翅的声音；听她来往、进出、说话、歌唱，并且想到自己是这种足音、这些话、这支歌的中心；不时表示自己的愉快，觉得自己越残缺，便越强大；在那种黑暗中，并正因为那种黑暗，自己成了这安琪儿归宿的星球；人生的乐事很少能与此相比。人生至高的幸福，便是感到自己有人爱；有人为你是这个样子而爱你，更进一步说，有人不问你是什么样子而仍旧一心爱你，那种感觉，盲人才有。在那种痛苦中，有人服侍，便是有人抚爱。他还缺少什么呢？不缺少什么。有了爱便说不上失明。并且这是何等的爱！完全是高尚品质构成的爱。有平安的地方便没有瞽瞢。一颗心摸索着在寻求另一颗心，并且得到了它。况且那颗得到了也证实了的心还是一个妇人的心。一只手扶着你，那是她的手；一只嘴拂着你的额头，那是她的嘴；在紧靠着你身旁的地方，你听到一种呼吸的声音，那声音也是她。得到她的一切，从她的信仰直到她的同情，从不和她分离，得到那种柔弱力量的援助，倚仗那根不屈不挠的芦草，亲手触到神明，并且可以把神明抱在怀里，有血有肉的上帝，那是何等的幸福！这颗心，这朵奥妙的仙花，那么神秘地开放了。即令以重见光明作代价，我们也不肯牺牲这朵花的影子。那天使的灵魂便在身旁，时时在身旁；假使她走开，也是为了再转来而走开的；她和梦一样地消失，又和实际一样地重行出现；我们觉得一阵暖气逼近身旁，这就是她来了。我们有说不尽的谧静、愉快和叹赏，我们自己便是黑暗中的光辉。还有万千种无微不至的照顾，许多小事在空虚中便具有重大意义。那种不可磨灭的女性的语声既可以催你入睡，又可以为你代替那失去了的宇宙。你受到了灵魂的爱抚。你什么也瞧不见，但是你感到了她的爱护。这是黑暗中的天堂。</P>

    卞福汝主教便是从这个天堂渡到那个天堂去的。</P>

    他的噩耗被滨海蒙特勒伊的地方报纸转载出来了。第二天，马德兰先生穿了一身全黑的衣服，帽子上戴了黑纱。</P>

    城里的人都注意到他的丧服，议论纷纷。这仿佛多少可以暗示出一点关于马德兰先生的来历。大家得出结论，认为他和这位年高德劭的主教有些瓜葛。那些客厅里的人都说“他为迪涅的主教穿孝”，这就大大提高了马德兰先生的身份，他一举而立即获得滨海蒙特勒伊高贵社会的某种器重。那地方的一个小型的圣日耳曼郊区①想取消从前对马德兰先生的歧视，因为他很可能是那主教的亲戚。从此年老的妇人都对他行更多的屈膝大礼，年少的女子也对他露出更多的笑容，马德兰先生也看出了自己在这些方面的优越地位。一天晚上，那个小小的大交际社会中的一个老妇人，自以为资格老，就有管闲事的权利，不揣冒亲吧？” </P>

    ①巴黎附近的圣日耳曼郊区是贵族居住的地方。</P>

    他说：“不是的，夫人。”</P>

    “但是您不是为他穿丧服吗？”那老寡妇又说。</P>

    他回答说：“那是因为我幼年时曾在他家里当过仆人。”</P>

    还有一件大家知道的事。每次有通烟囱的流浪少年打那城里经过时，市长先生总要派人叫他来，问他姓名，给他钱。这一情况在那些通烟囱的孩子们里一经传开以后，许多通烟囱的孩子便都要走过那地方。</P>

 Part 5 Book 6 Chapter 2 Jean Valjean Still Wears His Arm in a Sling

    To realize one's dream. To whom is this accorded? There must be elections for this in heaven; we are all candidates, unknown to ourselves; the angels vote. Cosette and Marius had been elected. </P>

    Cosette, both at the mayor's office and at church, was dazzling and touching. Toussaint, assisted by Nicolette, had dressed her. </P>

    Cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta, her robe of Binche guipure, a veil of English point, a necklace of fine pearls, a wreath of orange flowers; all this was white, and, from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth. It was an exquisite candor expanding and becoming transfigured in the light. One would have pronounced her a virgin on the point of turning into a goddess. </P>

    Marius' handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed; here and there, beneath the thick curls, pale lines--the scars of the barricade-- were visible.</P>

    The grandfather, haughty, with head held high, amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of Barras, escorted Cosette. He took the place of Jean Valjean, who, on account of his arm being still in a sling, could not give his hand to the bride. </P>

    Jean Valjean, dressed in black, followed them with a smile.</P>

    "Monsieur Fauchelevent," said the grandfather to him, "this is a fine day. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. Henceforth, there must be no sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I decree joy! Evil has no right to exist. That there should be any unhappy men is, in sooth, a disgrace to the azure of the sky. Evil does not come from man, who is good at bottom. All human miseries have for their capital and central government hell, otherwise, known as the Devil's Tuileries. Good, here I am uttering demagogical words! As far as I am concerned, I have no longer any political opinions; let all me be rich, that is to say, mirthful, and I confine myself to that."</P>

    When, at the conclusion of all the ceremonies, after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible "yesses," after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy, after having exchanged their rings, after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer, they arrived, hand in hand, admired and envied by all, Marius in black, she in white, preceded by the suisse, with the epaulets of a colonel, tapping the pavement with his halberd, between two rows of astonished spectators, at the portals of the church, both leaves of which were thrown wide open, ready to enter their carriage again, and all being finished, Cosette still could not believe that it was real. She looked at Marius, she looked at the crowd, she looked at the sky: it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream. Her amazed and uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty. They entered the same carriage to return home, Marius beside Cosette; M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean sat opposite them; Aunt Gillenormand had withdrawn one degree, and was in the second vehicle.</P>

    "My children," said the grandfather, "here you are, Monsieur le Baron and Madame la Baronne, with an income of thirty thousand livres." </P>

    And Cosette, nestling close to Marius, caressed his ear with an angelic whisper: "So it is true. My name is Marius. I am Madame Thou." </P>

    These two creatures were resplendent. They had reached that irrevocable and irrecoverable moment, at the dazzling intersection of all youth and all joy. They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire; they were forty years old taken together. It was marriage sublimated; these two children were two lilies. They did not see each other, they did not contemplate each other. Cosette perceived Marius in the midst of a glory; Marius perceived Cosette on an altar. And on that altar, and in that glory, the two apotheoses mingling, in the background, one knows not how, behind a cloud for Cosette, in a flash for Marius, there was the ideal thing, the real thing, the meeting of the kiss and the dream, the nuptial pillow. All the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication. It seemed to them that their sorrows, their sleepless nights, their tears, their anguish, their terrors, their despair, converted into caresses and rays of light, rendered still more charming the charming hour which was approaching; and that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy. How good it is to have suffered! Their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness. The long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension.</P>

    It was the same enchantment in two souls, tinged with voluptuousness in Marius, and with modesty in Cosette. They said to each other in low tones: "We will go back to take a look at our little garden in the Rue Plumet." The folds of Cosette's gown lay across Marius.</P>

    Such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality. One possesses and one supposes. One still has time before one to divine. The emotion on that day, of being at mid-day and of dreaming of midnight is indescribable. The delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the crowd, and inspired the passers-by with cheerfulness.</P>

    People halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of Saint-Paul, to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers quivering on Cosette's head.</P>

    Then they returned home to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. Marius, triumphant and radiant, mounted side by side with Cosette the staircase up which he had been borne in a dying condition. The poor, who had trooped to the door, and who shared their purses, blessed them. There were flowers everywhere. The house was no less fragrant than the church; after the incense, roses. They thought they heard voices carolling in the infinite; they had God in their hearts; destiny appeared to them like a ceiling of stars; above their heads they beheld the light of a rising sun. All at once, the clock struck. Marius glanced at Cosette's charming bare arm, and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the lace of her bodice, and Cosette, intercepting Marius' glance, blushed to her very hair. </P>

    Quite a number of old family friends of the Gillenormand family had been invited; they pressed about Cosette. Each one vied with the rest in saluting her as Madame la Baronne.</P>

    The officer, Theodule Gillenormand, now a captain, had come from Chartres, where he was stationed in garrison, to be present at the wedding of his cousin Pontmercy. Cosette did not recognize him. </P>

    He, on his side, habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome, retained no more recollection of Cosette than of any other woman. </P>

    "How right I was not to believe in that story about the lancer!" said Father Gillenormand, to himself.</P>

    Cosette had never been more tender with Jean Valjean. She was in unison with Father Gillenormand; while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims, she exhaled goodness like a perfume. Happiness desires that all the world should be happy.</P>

    She regained, for the purpose of addressing Jean Valjean, inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl. She caressed him with her smile.</P>

    A banquet had been spread in the dining-room.</P>

    Illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of a great joy. Mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy. They do not consent to be black. The night, yes; the shadows, no. If there is no sun, one must be made.</P>

    The dining-room was full of gay things. In the centre, above the white and glittering table, was a Venetian lustre with flat plates, with all sorts of colored birds, blue, violet, red, and green, perched amid the candles; around the chandelier, girandoles, on the walls, sconces with triple and quintuple branches; mirrors, silverware, glassware, plate, porcelain, faience, pottery, gold and silversmith's work, all was sparkling and gay. The empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets, so that where there was not a light, there was a flower. </P>

    In the antechamber, three violins and a flute softly played quartettes by Haydn.</P>

    Jean Valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing-room, behind the door, the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him. A few moments before they sat down to table, Cosette came, as though inspired by a sudden whim, and made him a deep courtesy, spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands, and with a tenderly roguish glance, she asked him: </P>

    "Father, are you satisfied?"</P>

    "Yes," said Jean Valjean, "I am content!"</P>

    "Well, then, laugh."</P>

    Jean Valjean began to laugh.</P>

    A few moments later, Basque announced that dinner was served.</P>

    The guests, preceded by M. Gillenormand with Cosette on his arm, entered the dining-room, and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table.</P>

    Two large arm-chairs figured on the right and left of the bride, the first for M. Gillenormand, the other for Jean Valjean. M. Gillenormand took his seat. The other arm-chair remained empty.</P>

    They looked about for M. Fauchelevent.</P>

    He was no longer there.</P>

    M. Gillenormand questioned Basque.</P>

    "Do you know where M. Fauchelevent is?"</P>

    "Sir," replied Basque, "I do, precisely. M. Fauchelevent told me to say to you, sir, that he was suffering, his injured hand was paining him somewhat, and that he could not dine with Monsieur le Baron and Madame la Baronne. That he begged to be excused, that he would come to-morrow. He has just taken his departure." </P>

    That empty arm-chair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a moment. But, if M. Fauchelevent was absent, M. Gillenormand was present, and the grandfather beamed for two. He affirmed that M. Fauchelevent had done well to retire early, if he were suffering, but that it was only a slight ailment.This declaration sufficed. Moreover, what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy? Cosette and Marius were passing through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness. And then, an idea occurred to M. Gillenormand.--"Pardieu, this armchair is empty. Come hither, Marius. Your aunt will permit it, although she has a right to you. This armchair is for you. That is legal and delightful. Fortunatus beside Fortunata."-- Applause from the whole table. Marius took Jean Valjean's place beside Cosette, and things fell out so that Cosette, who had, at first, been saddened by Jean Valjean's absence, ended by being satisfied with it. From the moment when Marius took his place, and was the substitute, Cosette would not have regretted God himself. She set her sweet little foot, shod in white satin, on Marius' foot. </P>

    The arm-chair being occupied, M. Fauchelevent was obliterated; and nothing was lacking. </P>

    And, five minutes afterward, the whole table from one end to the other, was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness. </P>

    At dessert, M. Gillenormand, rising to his feet, with a glass of champagne in his hand--only half full so that the palsy of his eighty years might not cause an overflow,--proposed the health of the married pair.</P>

    "You shall not escape two sermons," he exclaimed. "This morning you had one from the cure, this evening you shall have one from your grandfather. Listen to me; I will give you a bit of advice: Adore each other. I do not make a pack of gyrations, I go straight to the mark, be happy. In all creation, only the turtle-doves are wise. Philosophers say: Moderate your joys.' I say:`Give rein to your joys.' Be as much smitten with each other as fiends. Be in a rage about it. The philosophers talk stuff and nonsense. I should like to stuff their philosophy down their gullets again. Can there be too many perfumes, too many open rose-buds, too many nightingales singing, too many green leaves, too much aurora in life? Can people love each other too much? Can people please each other too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art too pretty! Have a care, Nemorin, thou art too handsome! Fine stupidity, in sooth! Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much? Can one be too much alive, too happy? Moderate your joys.Ah, indeed! Down with the philosophers! Wisdom consists in jubilation. Make merry, let us make merry. Are we happy because we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy diamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harley de Sancy, or because it weighs six hundred carats? I know nothing about it, life is full of such problems; the important point is to possess the Sancy and happiness. Let us be happy without quibbling and quirking. Let us obey the sun blindly. What is the sun? It is love. He who says love, says woman. Ah! Ah! Behold omnipotence--women. Ask that demagogue of a Marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette. And of his own free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no Robespierre who keeps his place but woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist except towards that royalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. No '89 for Eve. There has been the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there has been the imperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, there has been the sceptre of Charlemagne, which was of iron, there has been the sceptre of Louis the Great, which was of gold,-- the revolution twisted them between its thumb and forefinger, ha'penny straws; it is done with, it is broken, it lies on the earth, there is no longer any sceptre, but make me a revolution against that little embroidered handkerchief, which smells of patchouli! I should like to see you do it. Try. Why is it so solid? Because it is a gewgaw. Ah! You are the nineteenth century? Well, what then? And we have been as foolish as you. Do not imagine that you have effected much change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is called the cholera-morbus, and because your pourree is called the cachuca. In fact, the women must always be loved. I defy you to escape from that. These friends are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss formsa circle from which I defy you to escape; and, for my own part, I should be only too happy to re-enter it. Which of you has </P>

    seen the planet Venus, the coquette of the abyss, the Celimene of the ocean, rise in the infinite, calming all here below? The ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well, grumble as he will, when Venus appears he is forced to smile. That brute beast submits. We are all made so. Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, foam to the very ceiling. A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat on your face! Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day he is married. That is well. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Exist boldly for each other, make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same, idealize each other, catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth, and arrange yourselves a nest for life. Pardi, to love, to be loved, what a fine miracle when one is young! Don't imagine that you have invented that. I, too, have had my dream, I, too, have meditated, I, too, have sighed; I, too, have had a moonlight soul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has the right to a long white beard. Methusalem is a street arab beside Cupid. For sixty centuries men and women have got out of their scrape by loving. The devil, who is cunning, took to hating man; man, who is still more cunning, took to loving woman. In this way he does more good than the devil does him harm. This craft was discovered in the days of the terrestrial paradise. The invention is old, my friends, but it is perfectly new. Profit by it. Be Daphnis and Chloe, while waiting to become Philemon and Baucis. Manage so that, when you are with each other, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may be the sun for Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, let your fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rain be your wife's tears. And let it never rain in your household. You have filched the winning number in the lottery; you have gained the great prize, guard it well, keep it under lock and key, do not squander it, adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest. Believe what I say to you. It is good sense. And good sense cannot lie. Be a religion to each other. Each man has his own fashion of adoring God. Saperlotte! The best way to adore God is to love one's wife. I love thee! That's my catechism. He who loves is orthodox. The oath of Henri IV. Places sanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris! I don't belong to the religion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it. This astonishes me on the part of Henri IV. My friends, long live women! I am old, they say; It's astonishing how much I feel in the mood to be young. I should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods. Children who contrive to be beautiful and contented,--that intoxicates me. I would like greatly to get married, if any one would have me. It is impossible to imagine that God could have made us for anything but this:to idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves, to be dove-like, to be dainty, to bill and coo our loves from morn to night, to gaze at one's image in one's little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant, to plume oneself; that is the aim of life. There, let not that displease you which we used to think in our day, when we were young folks. Ah! Vertu-bamboche! What charming women there were in those days, and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses! I committed my ravages among them. Then love each other. If people did not love each other, I really do not see what use there would be in having any springtime; and for my own part, I should pray the good God to shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us, and to take away from us and put back in his box, the flowers, the birds, and the pretty maidens. My children, receive an old man's blessing.</P>

    The evening was gay, lively and agreeable. The grandfather's sovereign good humor gave the key-note to the whole feast, and each person regulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality. They danced a little, they laughed a great deal; it was an amiable wedding. Goodman Days of Yore might have been invited to it. However, he was present in the person of Father Gillenormand. </P>

    There was a tumult, then silence.</P>

    The married pair disappeared.</P>

    A little after midnight, the Gillenormand house became a temple.</P>

    Here we pause. On the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel with his finger on his lips.</P>

    The soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the celebration of love takes place.</P>

    There should be flashes of light athwart such houses. The joy which they contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls in brilliancy, and vaguely illuminate the gloom. It is impossible that this sacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to the infinite. Love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man and the woman takes place; the being one, the being triple, the being final, the human trinity proceeds from it. This birth of two souls into one, ought to be an emotion for the gloom. The lover is the priest; the ravished virgin is terrified. Something of that joy ascends to God. Where true marriage is, that is to say, where there is love, the ideal enters in. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows. If it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life, it is probable that we should behold the forms of night, the winged unknowns, the blue passers of the invisible, bend down, a throng of sombre heads,around the luminous house, satisfied, showering benedictions, pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances. If at that supreme hour, the wedded pair, dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone, were to listen, they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of wings. Perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels. That dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling. When two mouths, rendered sacred by love, approach to create, it is impossible that there should not be, above that ineffable kiss, a quivering throughout the immense mystery of stars. </P>

    These felicities are the true ones. There is no joy outside of these joys. Love is the only ecstasy. All the rest weeps. </P>

    To love, or to have loved,--this suffices. Demand nothing more. There is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life. To love is a fulfilment.</P>

    实现自己的梦想，谁有这种可能呢？为此上天一定要进行选择；我们都是没有意识到的候选人；天使在投票。珂赛特和马吕斯中选了。</P>

    珂赛特在市政府和教堂里艳丽夺目，非常动人。这是杜桑在妮珂莱特的帮助下替她打扮的。</P>

    珂赛特在白色软缎衬裙上面，穿着班希产的镂空花边的连衣裙，披着英国的针织花面纱，带着一串圆润的珍珠项链和戴着一顶桔子花的花冠；这一切都是洁白无瑕，这种雅净的装饰使珂赛特容光焕发。这是绝妙的天真在光明中扩展而且神化了，好象一个贞女正在幻变成为天仙。</P>

    马吕斯的美发光亮又芳香，在鬈发下好几处地方可以看到街垒给他带来的几条浅色伤痕。</P>

    外祖父华贵而神气，他的服装和姿态高度集中了巴拉斯①时代所有的优雅举止，他引着珂赛特。他代替吊着绷带不能搀扶新娘的冉阿让。 </P>

    ①巴拉斯（Paul　Barras，1755-1829），子爵，国民公会军司令，督政府的督政官。</P>

    冉阿让穿着黑色礼服，含笑跟在后面。</P>

    “割风先生，”外祖父向他说，“这是好日子。我投票表决悲痛和忧伤的结束，从今以后任何地方不应再有愁苦存在。我对天发誓！我颁布快乐！苦难没有理由存在。事实上现在还有不幸的人，这是上天的耻辱。痛苦不是人造成的，人的本性是善良的。一切痛苦的首府和中央政府就是地狱，换句话说，就是魔鬼的杜伊勒里宫。好呀，现在我也说起盅惑人心的话来啦！至于我，我已没有政治见解；但愿大家都富裕，就是说都愉快，我只要求这一点。”</P>

    所有的仪式都进行了：对市政府和神父的问题的无数次“是”的回答，在市政府和教堂的登记册上签了字，交换了结婚戒指，在香烟缭绕中双双并排跪在白色皱纹布的伞盖下，这之后他们这才手搀手，被大家赞美羡慕。马吕斯穿着黑色礼服，她是一身白，前面是带着上校肩章的教堂侍卫开道，用手中的戟跺响石板，他们走在两列赞叹的来宾中间，从教堂两扇大开着的门里走出来，一切都已结束，准备上车的时候，珂赛特还不相信这是真的。她看看马吕斯，看看大家，看看天，害怕醒来似的。她那种既惊讶又担心的神情，为她增添了一种说不出的魅力。回去时，马吕斯和珂赛特并肩同坐一车；吉诺曼先生和冉阿让坐在他们对面，吉诺曼姨妈退了一级，坐在第二辆车里。“我的孩子，”外祖父说，“你们现在是男爵先生和男爵夫人了，有三万利弗的年金。”于是珂赛特紧挨着马吕斯，在他耳边用天使般的妙音轻声说：“原来是真的。我叫马吕斯，我是‘你’夫人。”</P>

    这两个人容光焕发，他们正处在一去不复返、再难寻觅的一刹那，也就是处在整个青春和一切欢乐的光耀炫目的交叉点上。他们实现了让·勃鲁维尔的诗句所说的“他俩相加还不到四十岁”。这是崇高的结合，这两个孩子是两朵百合花。他们不是相互注视，而是相互礼拜。珂赛特觉得马吕斯是在荣光中；马吕斯感到珂赛特是在圣坛上。而在这圣坛上和在这荣光中，这两个神化了的人，其实已不知怎么合而为一了，对珂赛特来说是处在一层彩云之后，对马吕斯来说，则处在火焰般的光芒中。那里有着理想的东西，真实的东西，这就是接吻和梦幻般的相会，以及新婚的枕席。</P>

    他们经历过的苦难，回忆起来真令人陶醉。他们觉得现在已成为爱抚和光明的一切悲伤、失眠、流泪、忧虑、惊慌和失望，好象在使即将到来的令人喜悦的时刻变得更有魅力；对欢乐而言，好象悲伤已起到陪衬的作用。受过折磨是何等有益！他们的不幸构成了幸福的光圈。长期恋爱的苦闷使他们的感情升华了。</P>

    两个人的心灵同样感到销魂荡魄，马吕斯稍带点情欲，珂赛特则有点羞怯。他们轻声说：“我们再去卜吕梅街看看我们的小花园。”珂赛特的衣服折裥搭在马吕斯的身上。</P>

    这样的一天是梦幻和现实的混合。既占有却又是假设。目前还有时间来猜测。这一天，在中午去梦想午夜的情景是一种无法形容的激动情绪。两颗心里都洋溢着动人的幸福，使过路人也感到了轻松愉快。</P>

    行人在圣安东尼街圣保罗教堂前面停下来，为了透过马车的玻璃，看桔子花在珂赛特的头上颤动。</P>

    然后他们回到受难修女街家中。马吕斯与珂赛特胜利欢乐地并排走上过去人们在它上面拖回垂死的马吕斯的楼梯。穷人们聚集在门口分享他们的施舍，并且祝福新婚夫妇。到处都插满鲜花。家里象教堂里一样充满着芳香；在神香之后现在是玫瑰花。他们似乎听到天上有歌声；上帝在他们心中；他们的前途好象满天的星斗；他们看见了一道初升的阳光在头上闪耀。忽然时钟响了。马吕斯注视着珂赛特那裸露的迷人的粉臂和透过上衣的花边隐约可见的红润的地方，珂赛特察觉了马吕斯的目光，羞得面红耳赤。</P>

    很多吉诺曼家的老友都应邀而来，大家围着珂赛特，争先恐后地称她男爵夫人。</P>

    军官忒阿杜勒·吉诺曼，现在是上尉了，从他的部队驻扎地夏尔特尔来参加表弟彭眉胥的婚礼，珂赛特没有认出他来。</P>

    他呢，对妇女们称他为美男子已习以为常，一点也想不起珂赛特或其他任何女人。</P>

    “我幸好没有相信关于这个长矛兵的流言。”吉诺曼老爹心里暗想道。</P>

    对冉阿让，珂赛特从没有过此刻这样的温柔和体贴。她和吉诺曼老爹也和协一致；在他把快乐当作箴言准则的同时，如同香气一样她全身也散发着爱和善。幸福的人希望大家都幸福。</P>

    她和冉阿让谈话时，又用她幼年时的语气，对他微笑着表示亲热。</P>

    一桌酒席设在饭厅里。</P>

    亮如白昼的照明是盛大喜宴不可缺的点缀品。欢乐的人不能容忍昏暗和模糊不清。他们不愿呆在黑暗里。夜里，可以；</P>

    黑暗，不行。如果没有太阳，就得创造一个。</P>

    饭厅是一个摆满赏心悦目物品的大熔炉。正中，在雪白耀眼的饭桌的上方，吊着一盏威尼斯产的金属片制的烛台，上面有着各色的鸟：蓝的，紫的，红的，绿的，都栖息在蜡烛中间；在吊着的烛台四周有多枝的烛台，墙上挂有三重和五重的枝形壁灯反射镜；玻璃、水晶、玻璃器皿，餐具、瓷器、陶器、瓦器、金银器皿，一切都光彩夺目，玲珑可爱。烛台的空隙处，插满了花束，因此，没有烛光的地方就有花朵。</P>

    在候见室里有三把小提琴和一支笛子在轻声演奏着海顿的四重奏。</P>

    冉阿让坐在客厅里一张靠椅上，在门背后，这敞着的门几乎把他遮住了。上桌吃饭前片刻，珂赛特心血来潮，用双手把她的新娘礼服展开，向他行了个屈膝大礼，她带着温柔而调皮的目光问他：</P>

    “父亲，你高兴吗？”</P>

    冉阿让说：“我很高兴。”</P>

    “那你就笑一笑吧！”</P>

    冉阿让就笑起来了。</P>

    几分钟以后，巴斯克通知筵席已准备好了。</P>

    吉诺曼先生让珂赛特挽着他的手臂走在前面，和跟在后面的宾客一同进入餐厅，大家根据指定的位子，在桌旁入座。</P>

    两张大安乐椅摆在新娘的左右两旁。</P>

    第一张是吉诺曼先生的，第二张是冉阿让的。吉诺曼先生坐下了。另一张还空着。</P>

    大家的目光都在寻找“割风先生”。</P>

    他已不在了。</P>

    吉诺曼先生问巴斯克：</P>

    “你知道割风先生在哪儿吗？”</P>

    “老爷，”巴斯克回答，“正是割风先生叫我告诉老爷，他受了伤的手有点痛，他不能陪男爵先生和男爵夫人用餐，他请大家原谅他，他明天早晨来。他刚刚离去。”</P>

    这个空着的安乐椅，使喜宴上有片刻感到扫兴。割风先生缺席，但有吉诺曼先生在，外祖父兴致勃勃能抵两个人。他明确地说如果割风先生感到不舒服，那最好早点上床休息，又说，这只是轻微的一点“疼痛”。这点说明够了。更何况在一片欢乐中一个阴暗的角落又算得了什么？珂赛特和马吕斯正处在自私和受祝福的时刻，此时人除了见到幸福之外已没有其他能力了。于是吉诺曼先生灵机一动，“嗨，这椅子空着，你来，马吕斯。虽然按理你应坐在你姨妈旁边，但她会允许你坐过来的。这椅子是属于你的了。这是合法而且亲切的，如同财神挨近了福星。”全桌一致鼓掌。马吕斯便占了珂赛特旁边冉阿让的位子；经过这样的安排，珂赛特本来因冉阿让不在而不乐，结果却感到满意。既然马吕斯当了后补，珂赛特连上帝不在也不会惋惜的。她把她那柔软的穿着白缎鞋的小脚放在马吕斯的脚上。</P>

    椅子有人坐了，割风先生已被忘却；大家并不感到有什么欠缺。于是五分钟后，全桌的来宾已经笑逐颜开，什么都忘了。</P>

    餐后上水果点心时，吉诺曼先生起立，手中举着一杯不大满的香槟，这是因为他那九十二岁的高龄怕手颤而使酒溢出，他向新婚夫妇祝酒。</P>

    “你们逃避不了两次训戒，”他大声说，“早晨你们接受了教士的，晚上要接受外祖父的。听我说，我要劝告你们：‘你们相爱吧！’我不来搬弄一堆华丽的词藻，我直截了当地说，‘你们幸福吧！’天地万物没有比斑鸠更聪明的了。哲学家说欢乐要有分寸。我却说：‘要尽情欢乐，要象魔鬼那样热恋，如痴如醉。’哲学家是在胡诌，我要把他们的哲学塞回到他们的喉咙里去。人们难道会嫌芳香过分，玫瑰花开得过多，歌唱的黄莺太多，翠叶太多，生命中的清晨太多吗？难道人会爱得过火？难道双方会相互喜欢得过火？注意，爱丝特尔，你太美丽了！小心，内莫朗，你太漂亮了！这纯粹是蠢话！难道相互会过分迷恋、过分爱抚、过分使对方陶醉吗？难道生命的活力会过多？幸福会过分？欢乐要节制。呸！打倒哲学家！欢天喜地就是智慧。你们兴高采烈吧，让我们兴高采烈吧！我们感到幸福难道是由于我们善良？还是正因为我们是幸福的所以我们也是善良的呢？桑西所以被称作桑西，是因为它属于哈勒·德·桑西①呢还是因为它重一百○六克拉呢？关于这我一点也不知道；生活中充满了这类难题；重要的是去获得桑西和幸福。幸福吧！不要挑剔，要盲目地服从太阳。太阳是什么，就是爱情呀。提到爱情，就是指女人。啊！啊！无上权威就在这儿，这就是女人。你们问问这个造反的马吕斯，他是不是珂赛特这个小暴君的奴仆。他是心甘情愿的，这胆小鬼！女人！没有站得住脚的罗伯斯庇尔，还是女人掌权。我也只是这个王党的保王党员了。亚当是什么？他是夏娃的王国，对夏娃来说，是没有一七八九年的。有的君主权杖上有朵百合花，有的装着一个地球，查理曼大帝的权杖是铁的，路易十四的是金的，革命把这些权杖用大拇指和食指折断了，好象两文钱的麦秆一样拧弯了，完蛋了，断了，都倒在地上了，不再有权杖了；但是你们给我来造造这块香草味的绣花小手帕的反吧！我倒想瞧瞧你们敢不敢。试试吧。它为什么结实？因为是块布头。啊！你们是属于十九世纪的？那又怎么样呢？我们是属于十八世纪的！我们和你们一样愚蠢。你们管霍乱叫流行性霍乱，称奥弗涅舞蹈为卡朱沙。不要以为你们因此就使宇宙有多大改变，永远都得爱女人。我不信你们能摆脱得了。这些女魔是我们的天使。不错，爱情、女子、接吻，这个圈子你们跳不出来；至于我，我还想钻进去呢。你们之中谁曾见过，金星在天空升起，她是这个深渊上卖弄风情的女郎②。海洋里的色里曼纳，她安抚着下方的一切，好象一个美女在俯视狂涛。海洋是一个粗暴的阿尔赛斯特。它嘟囔也没用，维纳斯一露面，它就得喜笑颜开。这只野兽就被驯服了。我们大家都是这样的忿怒，咆哮，霹雳，怒气冲天。一个女人登上舞台，一颗星星升起，就都服服帖帖了！马吕斯六个月之前还在战斗，今天他结婚了。做得好。不错，马吕斯，对了，珂赛特，你们做得对。你们勇敢地为对方生存吧，特别亲昵，使别人因不能这样做而气得发疯，你们互相崇拜吧！用你们小小的鸟喙拾起地上所有的幸福草，设法用它做成你们一辈子的安乐窝。啊！恋爱，被爱，年轻时候的奇迹！你们不要以为这是你们发明的。我也曾有过幻梦、冥想和叹息，我也曾有过浪漫的心灵。爱神是一个六千岁的小孩。爱神有权长一口长长的白胡须，玛土撒拉在丘比特面前只是一个孩子。六十个世纪以来男女相爱，解决了一切问题，魔鬼，这个狡猾的东西，憎恨男子，男子比他更狡猾，去爱上女子。因此他得到的好处超过魔鬼给他的坏处。这种巧妙的事，自从开天辟地以来就存在了。朋友们，这个发明已经陈旧，可是它还很新颖。你们利用这个发明吧！你们目前可以是达夫尼斯和克罗埃③，将来你们再成为菲利门和波息司④。当你们在一起时，就应该一无所需，珂赛特要成为马吕斯的太阳，马吕斯要成为珂赛特的天地。珂赛特，你的艳阳天就是马吕斯的微笑；马吕斯，你的雨水就是妻子的泪珠，要使你们夫妻生活中永远不下雨。你们的爱情得到宗教的祝福，你们抽到了一个好签，是头彩，要好好保存，锁起来，不要浪费掉，要互敬互爱，此外可以不闻不问。相信我说的话。这是理智的。理智不会骗人。你们要象敬神一样相互敬重。每个人崇拜上帝的方式不同。见鬼！最高明的敬仰上帝的方式，就是爱自己的妻子。我爱你，这就是我的教理。谁爱，谁就是正教派。亨利四世的渎神话是把神圣放在盛宴和陶醉之间。‘畜生！⑤’我不信奉这句粗话的宗教。因为其中女人被忘却了。我很诧异亨利四世的亵渎的话竟会是这个。朋友们，女人万岁！据人说我是老了；我感到多么奇怪自己正越活越年轻。我很想到树林里去听听风笛。这两个孩子都是美而愉快的，这使我陶醉。我也千真万确地想结婚，如果有人愿意的话。不能设想上帝创造我们是为了别的原因，而不是为了狂热地爱，情话绵绵，精心打扮，当小宝贝，做最受女人赞赏的人，从早到晚亲吻爱人，为自己的爱妻自豪，得意洋洋，炫耀自负；这就是生活的目的。这些就是棗希望不要见怪棗我们那个时代，当我们是年轻人时的想法。啊！我发誓！那个时代迷人的女子可多啦，标致的面庞，年轻的少女！我使她们神魂颠倒。因此你们相爱吧。如果不相爱，我真不懂春天有什么用；至于我，我请求上帝，把他给我们看的一切美好的东西都拿回去，收藏起来，重新把花朵、小鸟、美女放进他的宝盒。孩子们，来接受一个老人的祝福吧！” </P>

    ①尼古拉·哈勒·德·桑西（Nicolas　Harlay　de　Sancy，1546-1629），法国行政长官，有一颗五十三克拉重的钻石，这颗钻石即名桑西。又桑西与法语中“一百○六”（cent　six）同音，故后面引出一百○六克拉之语。</P>

    ②维纳斯是罗马神话里爱和美的女神，在法语中又指金星。</P>

    ④菲利门（Philémon）和波息司（Baucis），神话中人物，象征夫妇恩爱，长寿，同生同死。</P>

    ⑤这是亨利四世惯用的骂人的话，法文是“肚子－圣人－醉”（ventreBsaintBgris）。</P>

    这一晚过得轻松愉快而亲切。外祖父极为舒畅的心情为节日定了调，每个人都为这将近一百岁老人的热诚而行事，大家跳了一会舞，笑声不绝；这是一个亲切的婚礼。真可以邀请“往昔”这位好好先生来参加。其实吉诺曼老爹也就等于是“昔日”这位好好先生了。</P>

    有过活跃热闹的场面，现在安静下来了。</P>

    新婚夫妇不见了。</P>

    午夜刚过，吉诺曼的屋子变成了一所庙宇。</P>

    到这里我们止步了。在新婚之夜的房门前，有一个微笑的天使站着，用一个手指按在唇边。</P>

    在这欢庆爱情的圣地之前，心灵进入了冥想的境界。</P>

    屋子的顶上肯定有微光在闪烁。屋里充满着喜悦的光芒，一定会从墙头的石缝中透露出来，把黑暗微微划破。这个命中注定的圣洁的喜事，不可能不放射出一道神光到太空中去。爱情是融合男人和女人的卓越的熔炉，单一的人，三人一体，最后的人，凡人的三位一体由此产生。两个心灵和合的诞生，一定会感动幽灵。情人是教士；被夺走的处女感到惊恐。这种欢乐多少会传送到上帝那里。真正的崇高的婚姻，即爱情的结合，就有着理想的境界。一张新婚的床在黑夜里是一角黎明，如果允许肉眼看见这些可畏而又迷人的上天的形象，我们可能见到夜里的那些形体，长着翅膀的陌生人，看不见的蓝色的旅客，弯着腰，一簇黑影似的人头，在发光的房屋的周围，他们感到满意，祝福新婚夫妇，互相指着处女新娘，他们也略感紧张，他们神圣的容貌上有着人间幸福的反照。新婚夫妇在至高无上的销魂极乐时刻，认为没有他人在旁，如果倾耳谛听，他们就可以听见簌簌的纷乱的翅膀声。完美的幸福引来了天使的共同的关怀。在这间黑暗的小寝室上面，有整个天空作为房顶。当两人的嘴唇，被爱情所纯化，为了创造而互相接近时，在这个无法形容的接吻上空，辽阔而神秘的繁星，不会没有一阵震颤。</P>

    这幸福是真实不虚的，除了这一欢乐外没有其他的欢乐。</P>

    唯独爱令人感到心醉神迷。此外一切都是可悲可泣的。</P>

    爱和曾爱过，这就够了。不必再作其他希求。在生活的黑暗褶子里，是找不到其他的珍珠的。爱是完满的幸福。</P>

 Part 5 Book 6 Chapter 3 The Inseparable

    What had become of Jean Valjean?</P>

    Immediately after having laughed, at Cosette's graceful command, when no one was paying any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen and had gained the antechamber unperceived. This was the very room which, eight months before, he had entered black with mud, with blood and powder, bringing back the grandson to the grandfather. The old wainscoting was garlanded with foliage and flowers; the musicians were seated on the sofa on which they had laid Marius down. Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, white stockings and white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishes that were to be served. Jean Valjean pointed to his arm in its sling, charged Basque to explain his absence, and went away.</P>

    The long windows of the dining-room opened on the street. Jean Valjean stood for several minutes, erect and motionless in the darkness, beneath those radiant windows. He listened. The confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear. He heard the loud, commanding tones of the grandfather, the violins, the clatter of the plates, the bursts of laughter, and through all that merry uproar, he distinguished Cosette's sweet and joyous voice. </P>

    He quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, and returned to the Rue de l'Homme Arme.</P>

    In order to return thither, he took the Rue Saint-Louis, the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and the Blancs-Manteaux; it was a little longer, but it was the road through which, for the last three months, he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the Rue de l'Homme Arme to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, in order to avoid the obstructions and the mud in the Rue Vielle-du-Temple. </P>

    This road, through which Cosette had passed, excluded for him all possibility of any other itinerary. </P>

    Jean Valjean entered his lodgings. He lighted his candle and mounted the stairs. The apartment was empty. Even Toussaint was no longer there. Jean Valjean's step made more noise than usual in the chambers. All the cupboards stood open. He penetrated to Cosette's bedroom. There were no sheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with ticking, and without a case or lace, was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress, whose covering was visible, and on which no one was ever to sleep again. All the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had been carried away; nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls. Toussaint's bed was despoiled in like manner. One bed only was made up, and seemed to be waiting some one, and this was Jean Valjean's bed.</P>

    Jean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard doors, and went and came from one room to another. </P>

    Then he sought his own chamber once more, and set his candle on a table.</P>

    He had disengaged his arm from the sling, and he used his right hand as though it did not hurt him. </P>

    He approached his bed, and his eyes rested, was it by chance? was it intentionally? on the inseparable of which Cosette had been jealous, on the little portmanteau which never left him. On his arrival in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, on the 4th of June, he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed. He went to this table with a sort of vivacity, took a key from his pocket, and opened the valise.</P>

    From it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years before, Cosette had quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, then the black fichu, then the stout, coarse child's shoes which Cosette might almost have worn still, so tiny were her feet, then the fustian bodice, which was very thick, then the knitted petticoat, next the apron with pockets, then the woollen stockings. These stockings, which still preserved the graceful form of a tiny leg, were no longer than Jean Valjean's hand. All this was black of hue. It was he who had brought those garments to Montfermeil for her. As he removed them from the valise, he laid them on the bed. He fell to thinking. He called up memories. It was in winter, in a very cold month of December, she was shivering, half-naked, in rags, her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes. He, Jean Valjean, had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these mourning habiliments. The mother must have felt pleased in her grave, to see her daughter wearing mourning for her, and, above all, to see that she was properly clothed, and that she was warm. He thought of that forest of Montfermeil; they had traversed it together, Cosette and he; he thought of what the weather had been, of the leafless trees, of the wood destitute of birds, of the sunless sky; it mattered not, it was charming. He arranged the tiny garments on the bed, the fichu next to the petticoat, the stockings beside the shoes, and he looked at them, one after the other. She was no taller than that, she had her big doll in her arms, she had put her louis d'or in the pocket of that apron, she had laughed, they walked hand in hand, she had no one in the world but him.</P>

    Then his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, that stoical old heart broke, his face was engulfed, so to speak, in Cosette's garments, and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment, he would have heard frightful sobs.</P>

    冉阿让后来怎么样了？</P>

    在珂赛特的亲切命令下，冉阿让笑了之后，乘人不备，立刻站起身来，没有人察觉，他走到了候客室。就是在这间屋子里，八个月以前，他满身污泥，又是血，又是灰尘，把外孙送来给外祖父的。那些老式的木器上都有着花和叶的装饰，琴师们坐在过去放置马吕斯的长椅上。巴斯克穿着黑色上衣、短裤、白袜和戴着白手套，把玫瑰花圈放在每一盘要上的菜的四周。冉阿让向他指着自己吊着绷带的手臂，托他解释他缺席的原因，就出去了。</P>

    饭厅的格子窗向着大街，冉阿让一动不动地在黑暗中闪亮的窗子下面站了几分钟。他听着。酒席上的嘈杂声传到了他耳边。他听见外祖父那高亢而带有命令口气的讲话、小提琴声、杯盘的叮当声、哈哈大笑声，在整个欢乐的喧哗声中，他能辨别出珂赛特的温柔而愉快的声音。</P>

    他离开了受难修女街，回到了武人街。</P>

    回家时，他经过圣路易街、圣卡特琳园地街和白大衣商店，这路线比较长，但这是三个月以来，为了避免拥挤和老人堂街的泥泞，他和珂赛特每日从武人街到受难修女街常走的路。</P>

    这条珂赛特走过的路，使他摒弃了任何其他路线。</P>

    冉阿让回到家。他点起蜡烛上楼。房间是空的。杜桑也不在了。冉阿让在房中的脚步声比往日要响些。所有橱柜都敞开着。他走进珂赛特的房间。床上已没有垫单。细棉布的枕心，没有枕套也没有花边，放在褥子脚头折叠好了的被套上，垫褥露出了麻布套子，没有人再来睡了。一切珂赛特喜爱的女人用的小物品她都带走了；只剩下笨重的木器和四堵墙。杜桑的床也同样剥光了，只有一张床是铺好的，似乎等待着一个人，这就是冉阿让的床。</P>

    冉阿让看看墙头，关上几扇橱门，从这间房走到那间房。</P>

    然后他回到自己的房中，把蜡烛放在桌上。</P>

    他把手从吊带中解出来，他使用右手就象他没有感到疼痛那样。</P>

    他走近卧铺，他的目光，不知是偶然还是有意，停留在那“难分难舍的东西”上面，这就是珂赛特过去曾经妒忌过的那只他不离身的小箱子。当他六月四日来到武人街时，便把它放在床头一张独脚小圆桌上。他迅速走向圆桌，从口袋中取出一把钥匙，把小箱子打开。</P>

    他慢慢地把十年前珂赛特离开孟费郿时穿的衣服拿出来；先取出黑色小衣服，再取出黑色方围巾，再取出粗笨的童靴，珂赛特现在差不多还能穿得下，因为她的脚很小巧，接着他又取出很厚的粗斜纹布紧身上衣，还有针织品的短裙，又取出有口袋的围裙，再取出毛线袜。这双毛线袜还很可爱的保留着孩子小腿的形状，它比冉阿让的手掌长不了多少。这一切都是黑色的。是他把这些服装带到孟费郿给她穿的。他一边取出衣物，一边放在床上。他在想。他在回忆。那是一个冬季，一个严寒的十二月，她半裸着身体在破衣烂衫中颤抖，可怜的小脚在木鞋中冻得通红。是他冉阿让，使她脱下了这褴褛的衣服，换上了孝服。那位母亲在坟墓中见到女儿在替她戴孝，尤其是见到她有衣服穿而且还很暖和时该有多么高兴啊！他想起了孟费郿的森林；他们是一同穿过的，珂赛特和他；他回想起当时的天气，想起了没有叶子的树，没有鸟的林，没有太阳的天；尽管如此，一切都非常可爱。他把小衣服摆在床上，围巾放在短裙旁，绒袜放在靴子旁，内衣放在连衣裙旁，他一样一样地看。她只有这么高，她怀里抱着她的玩具大娃娃，她把她的金路易放在围裙口袋里，她笑呀笑呀，他们手搀着手向前走，她在世上只有他一个人。</P>

    于是他那白发苍苍可敬的头倒到床上，这个镇静的老人的心碎了，他的脸可以说是埋在珂赛特的衣服里，如果这时有人从楼梯上走过，就可以听见沉痛的哀嚎。</P>

 Part 5 Book 6 Chapter 4 The Immortal Liver

    [68] In allusion to the story of Prometheus.</P>

    The old and formidable struggle, of which we have already witnessed so many phases, began once more.</P>

    Jacob struggled with the angel but one night. Alas! How many times have we beheld Jean Valjean seized bodily by his conscience, in the darkness, and struggling desperately against it! </P>

    Unheard-of conflict! At certain moments the foot slips; at other moments the ground crumbles away underfoot. How many times had that conscience, mad for the good, clasped and overthrown him! How many times had the truth set her knee inexorably upon his breast! How many times, hurled to earth by the light, had he begged for mercy! How many times had that implacable spark, lighted within him, and upon him by the Bishop, dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind! How many times had he risen to his feet in the combat, held fast to the rock, leaning against sophism, dragged in the dust, now getting the upper hand of his conscience, again overthrown by it! How many times, after an equivoque, after the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism, had he heard his irritated conscience cry in his ear: "A trip! You wretch!" How many times had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat, under the evidence of duty! Resistance to God. Funereal sweats. What secret wounds which he alone felt bleed! What excoriations in his lamentable existence! How many times he had risen bleeding, bruised, broken, enlightened, despair in his heart, serenity in his soul! and, vanquished, he had felt himself the conqueror. And, after having dislocated, broken, and rent his conscience with red-hot pincers, it had said to him, as it stood over him, formidable, luminous, and tranquil: "Now, go in peace!"</P>

    But on emerging from so melancholy a conflict, what a lugubrious peace, alas!</P>

    Nevertheless, that night Jean Valjean felt that he was passing through his final combat.</P>

    A heart-rending question presented itself.</P>

    Predestinations are not all direct; they do not open out in a straight avenue before the predestined man; they have blind courts, impassable alleys, obscure turns, disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many ways. Jean Valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of these crossroads.</P>

    He had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil. He had that gloomy intersection beneath his eyes. On this occasion once more, as had happened to him already in other sad vicissitudes, two roads opened out before him, the one tempting, the other alarming.</P>

    Which was he to take?</P>

    He was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness.</P>

    Once more, Jean Valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the smiling ambush. </P>

    Is it then true? the soul may recover; but not fate. Frightful thing! An incurable destiny! </P>

    This is the problem which presented itself to him:</P>

    In what manner was Jean Valjean to behave in relation to the happiness of Cosette and Marius? It was he who had willed that happiness, it was he who had brought it about; he had, himself, buried it in his entrails, and at that moment, when he reflected on it, he was able to enjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizing his factory mark on a knife, on withdrawing it, all smoking, from his own breast. </P>

    Cosette had Marius, Marius possessed Cosette. They had everything, even riches. And this was his doing. </P>

    But what was he, Jean Valjean, to do with this happiness, now that it existed, now that it was there? Should he force himself on this happiness? Should he treat it as belonging to him? No doubt, Cosette did belong to another; but should he, Jean Valjean, retain of Cosette all that he could retain? Should he remain the sort of father, half seen but respected, which he had hitherto been? Should he, without saying a word, bring his past to that future? Should he present himself there, as though he had a right, and should he seat himself, veiled, at that luminous fireside? Should he take those innocent hands into his tragic hands, with a smile? Should he place upon the peaceful fender of the Gillenormand drawing-room those feet of his, which dragged behind them the disgraceful shadow of the law? Should he enter into participation in the fair fortunes of Cosette and Marius? Should he render the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense? Should he place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity? Should he continue to hold his peace? In a word, should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two happy beings?</P>

    We must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it, in order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear to us in all their horrible nakedness. Good or evil stands behind this severe interrogation point. What are you going to do? Demands the sphinx.</P>

    This habit of trial Jean Valjean possessed. He gazed intently at the sphinx.</P>

    He examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects.</P>

    Cosette, that charming existence, was the raft of this shipwreck. What was he to do? To cling fast to it, or to let go his hold? </P>

    If he clung to it, he should emerge from disaster, he should ascend again into the sunlight, he should let the bitter water drip from his garments and his hair, he was saved, he should live.</P>

    And if he let go his hold?</P>

    Then the abyss.</P>

    Thus he took sad council with his thoughts. Or, to speak more correctly, he fought; he kicked furiously internally, now against his will, now against his conviction.</P>

    Happily for Jean Valjean that he had been able to weep. That relieved him, possibly. But the beginning was savage. A tempest, more furious than the one which had formerly driven him to Arras, broke loose within him. The past surged up before him facing the present; he compared them and sobbed. The silence of tears once opened, the despairing man writhed.</P>

    He felt that he had been stopped short.</P>

    Alas! in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty, when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal, bewildered, furious, exasperated at having to yield, disputing the ground, hoping for a possible flight, seeking an escape, what an abrupt and sinister resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear!</P>

    To feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle!</P>

    The invisible inexorable, what an obsession!</P>

    Then, one is never done with conscience. Make your choice, Brutus; make your choice, Cato. It is fathomless, since it is God. One flings into that well the labor of one's whole life, one flings in one's fortune, one flings in one's riches, one flings in one's success, one flings in one's liberty or fatherland, one flings in one's well-being, one flings in one's repose, one flings in one's joy! More! More! More! Empty the vase! Tip the urn! One must finish by flinging in one's heart.</P>

    Somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells, there is a tun like that.</P>

    Is not one pardonable, if one at last refuses! Can the inexhaustible have any right? Are not chains which are endless above human strength? Who would blame Sisyphus and Jean Valjean for saying: "It is enough!"</P>

    The obedience of matter is limited by friction; is there no limit to the obedience of the soul? If perpetual motion is impossible, can perpetual self-sacrifice be exacted?</P>

    The first step is nothing, it is the last which is difficult. What was the Champmathieu affair in comparison with Cosette's marriage and of that which it entailed? What is are-entrance into the galleys, compared to entrance into the void?</P>

    Oh, first step that must be descended, how sombre art thou! Oh, second step, how black art thou! </P>

    How could he refrain from turning aside his head this time?</P>

    Martyrdom is sublimation, corrosive sublimation. It is a torture which consecrates. One can consent to it for the first hour; one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron, one places on one's head the crown of hot iron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, one takes the sceptre of red hot iron, but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned, and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering? </P>

    At length, Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion.</P>

    He weighed, he reflected, he considered the alternatives, the mysterious balance of light and darkness.</P>

    Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should he consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself? On one side lay the sacrifice of Cosette, on the other that of himself. </P>

    At what solution should he arrive? What decision did he come to?</P>

    What resolution did he take? What was his own inward definitive response to the unbribable interrogatory of fatality? What door did he decide to open? Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning? Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was his choice? What extremity did he accept? To which of the gulfs did he nod his head?</P>

    His dizzy revery lasted all night long.</P>

    He remained there until daylight, in the same attitude, bent double over that bed, prostrate beneath the enormity of fate, crushed, perchance, alas! With clenched fists, with arms outspread at right angles, like a man crucified who has been un-nailed, and flung face down on the earth. There he remained for twelve hours, the twelve long hours of a long winter's night, ice-cold, without once raising his head, and without uttering a word. He was as motionless as a corpse, while his thoughts wallowed on the earth and soared, now like the hydra, now like the eagle. Any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead; all at once he shuddered convulsively, and his mouth, glued to Cosette's garments, kissed them; then it could be seen that he was alive. </P>

    Who could see? Since Jean Valjean was alone, and there was no one there.</P>

    The One who is in the shadows.</P>

    ①“不死的肝脏”，原文为拉丁文“ImmortaleJecur”。普罗米修斯因窃天火给人类，被钉在高加索山的悬崖上，宙斯每天叫一只大鹰啄食他的肝脏，到了夜晚啄食掉的肝脏又恢复原状。</P>

    以往可怕的搏斗，我们曾见过好几个回合，现在又开始了。</P>

    雅各和天使只搏斗了一宵。可叹的是，我们见到多少次冉阿让在黑暗中被自己的良心所擒，不顾死活地和它搏斗。</P>

    闻所未闻的恶斗！有时是失足滑脱，有时是土地塌陷。这颗狂热追求正义的良心多少次把他箍紧而压服！多少次，这个不可逃避的真理，用膝盖压住他的胸膛！多少次，他被光明打翻在地，大声求饶！多少次，主教在他身上，在他内心点燃的这个铁面无私的光明，在他希望看不见时，却照得他眼都发花！多少次，他在斗争中重新站起来，抓住岩石，依仗诡辩，在尘埃里打滚，有时他把良心压在身下，有时又被良心打翻！多少次，在支吾其辞、在以自私为出发点的一种背叛的似是而非的推论之后，他听见愤怒的良心在他耳边狂呼：“阴谋家！无耻！”多少次，他执拗的思想在无可否认的职责前痉挛地辗转不安！对上帝的抗拒。悲伤的流汗。多少暗伤，只有他自己感到仍在流血！他悲惨的一生中有过多少伤痛！多少次他重新站了起来，鲜血淋淋，受了致命伤，碰到挫折，于是恍然大悟，心里绝望，灵魂却宁静了！他虽然失败，但却感到胜利了。他的良心使他四肢脱臼，受到百般折磨，筋断骨折之后，就站在他上面，令人望而生畏，这良心光芒四射，在安详地向他说：“现在，平安无事了！”</P>

    但经过这样一场沉痛的搏斗之后，唉！这是多么凄惨的一种平安！</P>

    然而这一夜，冉阿让感到他打的是最后一仗。</P>

    一个使人心碎的问题出现了。</P>

    天命不是一直都是笔直的，它们在命运已经注定的人面前展开的不是一条直的路；有绝路、死胡同①、黑暗的拐弯、令人焦急的多岔道的交叉路口。冉阿让此刻正停留在这样一个最危险的交叉路口上。 </P>

    ①死胡同，原文为拉丁文cacums。</P>

    他已到了最重要的一个善恶交叉的路口。这个暗中的交叉点就在他眼前。这次和以往在痛苦的波折里一样，两条路出现在他面前，一条诱惑他，另一条使他惊骇。究竟走哪一条路呢？</P>

    一条可怕的路是，当我们注视黑暗时，就能见到一个神秘的手指在指引着。</P>

    冉阿让又一次要在可怕的避风港和诱人的陷阱这两者之间作出选择。</P>

    据说灵魂能痊愈而命运则不能。难道这话是真的？多么可怕的事，一个无法挽救的命运！</P>

    出现的问题是这样的：</P>

    对于珂赛特和马吕斯的幸福冉阿让应抱什么态度？这一幸福是他愿意的，是他一手造成的，是他用尽心血使之实现的，此刻望着这个成果，他感到的满意，正如一个铸剑师看见从他胸口拔出来的热气腾腾的刀上，有自己铸造的标记。</P>

    珂赛特有了马吕斯，马吕斯占有了珂赛特。他们应有尽有，也不缺财富。这都是他一手造成的。</P>

    但这个幸福，现在既已存在，并且就在眼前，他冉阿让将如何对待？他是否硬要进入这一幸福中去？是否把它看成是属于他的呢？珂赛特当然已归另一个人，但他冉阿让还能保持他和珂赛特间一切能保持的关系吗？和以往一样当作一个偶尔见见面但受到敬重的父亲？他能泰然进入珂赛特的家里去吗？他能一言不发，把他的过去带到这未来的生活中去吗？他是否感到有权进去，并且戴着面罩，坐在这个光明的家庭里？他是否能含着笑用他悲惨的双手来和纯洁的孩子们握手呢？他能把带着法律上不名誉的黑影的双脚放在吉诺曼客厅中安静的壁炉柴架上吗？他能这么进去同珂赛特和马吕斯分享好运吗？他是否要把自己额上的黑影加深并使他们额上的乌云也加厚？他要把他的灾祸搀杂在他们两人的幸福里吗？继续隐瞒下去吗？总之一句话，在这两个幸运儿身旁，他将是命运阴森的哑巴？</P>

    当有些可怕的问题赤裸裸地暴露在我们面前时，必须对无数和一系列厄运感到习惯我们才敢正视这些问题。善或恶就在这严厉的问号后面。你打算怎么办呢？斯芬克司在问他。</P>

    冉阿让惯于接受这些考验，他目不转睛地看着斯芬克司。</P>

    他从各个方面去考虑这个残酷的问题。</P>

    珂赛特，这个可爱的生命，是沉溺者得救的木筏。怎么办？</P>

    抓紧它，还是松手？</P>

    如果抓紧，他可以脱离灾难，又回到阳光下，他可以使苦水从衣服和头发里流干净，他就得救了，他就能活了。</P>

    松手吗？</P>

    那就是深渊。</P>

    他痛苦地和思想协商。或者说得准确一点，他在斗争；拳打脚踢，怒火冲天，内心里有时反对自己的意愿，有时反对自己的信心。</P>

    痛哭对冉阿让来说是一种幸福。这样可能使他清醒。但开始时相当猛烈。一阵汹涌的波涛比过去把他推向阿拉斯时还更强烈，象脱了锁链似的在他心里爆发出来。过去又回来和现在正面相对；他比较了一下，于是嚎啕痛哭，眼泪的闸门一开，这个失望的人便哭得直不起腰来。</P>

    他感到出路被挡住了。</P>

    可叹的是，这种自私心和责任感之间的激烈拳击，当我们在不能剥夺的理想面前一步一步后退时，会心乱如麻，顽强抗拒的，我们为后退而激怒，寸土必争，希望有逃脱的可能，当我们正在寻找出路，忽然在我们后面碰到一堵墙。这是多么可怕的阻碍啊！</P>

    感到了神圣的黑影在挡住去路！</P>

    严正的冥冥上苍，怎么也摆脱不掉！</P>

    因此和良心打交道是没完没了的。布鲁图斯，你就死了心吧！卡托，你死了心吧。为了上帝，良心是无底的坑。我们可以把一生的事业丢进这深井，把家产丢进去，把财富丢进去，把成就丢进去，把自由或祖国丢进去，把舒适丢进去，把安息丢进去，把快乐丢进去。还要！还要！还要！把瓶子倒空！把罐子侧过来！最后还要把自己的心也丢进去。</P>

    在古老的地狱某一处的烟雾中，有一个这样的桶。</P>

    最后拒绝这样做，难道不能被原谅吗？可以有权没完没了地折磨人吗？漫长的锁链难道不是超过了人的耐力吗？谁会责备西绪福斯和冉阿让，如果他们说：“受够了！”</P>

    物质的服从是被磨擦所限制的；难道灵魂的服从没有一个限度？如果永恒的运转是不存在的，是否能要求永久的忠诚呢？</P>

    第一步不算什么，最后一步才是艰巨的。商马第事件和珂赛特的婚姻及其后果比起来又算得了什么？和再进牢房和变得一无所有比起来又算得了什么？</P>

    啊！要走的这第一步，你是多么暗淡呀！第二步，你是多么黑暗呀！</P>

    这一次怎么能不把头掉过去呢？</P>

    殉难者有高尚的品德，一种腐蚀性的高尚。这是一种使人圣化的磨难。开始时还能忍受，坐了烧红了的铁宝座，把红铁冠戴在头上，接过火红的铁地球，拿着火红的权杖，还要穿上火焰的外套，悲惨的肉身难道一刻也不能反抗，难道永远没有拒绝肉刑的时候？</P>

    最后冉阿让在失望中安静了。</P>

    他衡量，默想，他考虑着这个在轮番起落的光明和黑暗的神秘天平。</P>

    让这两个前途无限光明的孩子来承担他的徒刑，或是他自己来完成他那无可救药的沉沦。一边是牺牲珂赛特，另一边是牺牲自己。</P>

    他作了什么结论？采取了什么决定？他内心对这永不变化的命运的审问，最终将如何作答？他决定打开哪一扇门？他决定关掉并封闭生命中的哪一边？处在四周被深不可测的悬崖围困之中，他的选择是什么？他接受哪一条末路？他向这些深渊中的哪一条点头表示同意？</P>

    他经过了一整夜的头晕目眩的苦思。</P>

    他用同样的姿势呆到天明，在床上，上身扑在两膝上，被巨大的命运所压服，也许被压垮了，唉！他两拳紧握，两臂伸成直角，好象一个被钉在十字架上刚取下来的人，脸朝地被扔在那里。他呆了十二个小时，一个隆冬漫漫长夜里的十二个小时，他冻得冰凉，但没有抬一下头，也没有说一句话。一动不动，就象死尸一样，这时，他的思潮在地下打滚又腾空，有时象七头蛇，有时象鹰鹫。他一动不动，象个死人；忽然他痉挛地颤抖起来，他贴在珂赛特衣服上的嘴又在吻这些衣服；这时人才看到他是活着的。</P>

    谁？人？既然冉阿让是一个人，并没有任何人在旁？</P>

    这是个在暗中的“人”。</P>

 Part 5 Book 7 Chapter 1 The Seventh Circle and the Eighth Heaven

    The days that follow weddings are solitary. People respect the meditations of the happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, to some degree. The tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on. On the morning of the 17th of February, it was a little past midday when Basque, with napkin and feather-duster under his arm, busy in setting his antechamber to rights, heard a light tap at the door. There had been no ring, which was discreet on such a day. Basque opened the door, and beheld M. Fauchelevent.He introduced him into the drawing-room, still encumbered and topsy-turvy, and which bore the air of a field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening.</P>

    "Dame, sir," remarked Basque, "we all woke up late."</P>

    "Is your master up?" asked Jean Valjean.</P>

    "How is Monsieur's arm?" replied Basque.</P>

    "Better. Is your master up?"</P>

    "Which one? The old one or the new one?"</P>

    "Monsieur Pontmercy."</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron," said Basque, drawing himself up.</P>

    A man is a Baron most of all to his servants. He counts for something with them; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with the title, and that flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, a militant republican as he had proved, was now a Baron in spite of himself. A small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title. It was now M. Gillenormand who clung to it, and Marius who detached himself from it. But Colonel Pontmercy had written: "My son will bear my title." Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the woman was beginning to dawn, was delighted to be a Baroness. </P>

    "Monsieur le Baron?" repeated Basque. "I will go and see. I will tell him that M. Fauchelevent is here." </P>

    "No. Do not tell him that it is I. Tell him that some one wishes to speak to him in private, and mention no name." </P>

    "Ah!" ejaculated Basque. </P>

    "I wish to surprise him."</P>

    "Ah!" ejaculated Basque once more, emitting his second "ah!" as an explanation of the first. </P>

    And he left the room.</P>

    Jean Valjean remained alone.</P>

    The drawing-room, as we have just said, was in great disorder. It seemed as though, by lending an air, one might still hear the vague noise of the wedding. On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from garlands and head-dresses. The wax candles, burned to stumps, added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers. Not a single piece of furniture was in its place. In the corners, three or four arm-chairs, drawn close together in a circle, had the appearance of continuing a conversation. The whole effect was cheerful. A certain grace still lingers round a dead feast. It has been a happy thing. On the chairs in disarray, among those fading flowers, beneath those extinct lights, people have thought of joy. The sun had succeeded to the chandelier, and made its way gayly into the drawing-room.</P>

    Several minutes elapsed. Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot where Basque had left him. He was very pale. His eyes were hollow, and so sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in their orbits. His black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has been up all night. The elbows were whitened with the down which the friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it. </P>

    Jean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his feet by the sun.</P>

    There came a sound at the door, and he raised his eyes.</P>

    Marius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribable light on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant. He had not slept either.</P>

    "It is you, father!" he exclaimed, on catching sight of Jean Valjean; "that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious air! But you have come too early. It is only half past twelve. Cosette is asleep."</P>

    That word: "Father," said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified: supreme felicity. There had always existed, as the reader knows, a lofty wall, a coldness and a constraint between them; ice which must be broken or melted. Marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall was lowered, when the ice dissolved, and when M. Fauchelevent was to him, as to Cosette, a father. </P>

    He continued: his words poured forth, as is the peculiari ty of divine paroxysms of joy. </P>

    "How glad I am to see you! If you only knew how we missed you yesterday! Good morning, father. How is your hand? Better, is it not?" </P>

    And, satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself, he pursued:</P>

    "We have both been talking about you. Cosette loves you so dearly! You must not forget that you have a chamber here, We want nothing more to do with the Rue de l'Homme Arme. We will have no more of it at all. How could you go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, which is disagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where one is cold, and into which one cannot enter? You are to come and install yourself here. And this very day. Or you will have to deal with Cosette. She means to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have your own chamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the garden; the trouble with the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, it is all ready, you have only to take possession of it. Near your bed Cosette has placed a huge, old, easy-chair covered with Utrecht velvet and she has said to it: `Stretch out your arms to him.' A nightingale comes to the clump of acacias opposite your windows, every spring. In two months more you will have it. You will have its nest on your left and ours on your right. By night it will sing, and by day Cosette will prattle. Your chamber faces due South. Cosette will arrange your books for you, your Voyages of Captain Cook and the other,--Vancouver's and all your affairs. I believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached, I have fixed upon a corner of honor for that. You have conquered my grandfather, you suit him. We will live together. Do you play whist? You will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play whist. It is you who shall take Cosette to walk on the days when I am at the courts, you shall give her your arm, you know, as you used to, in the Luxembourg. We are absolutely resolved to be happy. And you shall be included in it, in our happiness, do you hear, father? Come, will you breakfast with us to-day?" </P>

    "Sir," said Jean Valjean, "I have something to say to you. I am an ex-convict."</P>

    The limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, as well in the case of the mind as in that of the ear. These words: "I am an ex-convict," proceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and entering the ear of Marius overshot the possible. It seemed to him that something had just been said to him; but he did not know what. He stood with his mouth wide open.</P>

    Then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful. Wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state, he had not, up to that moment, observed the other man's terrible pallor. </P>

    Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm, unrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb and showed it to Marius.</P>

    "There is nothing the matter with my hand," said he.</P>

    Marius looked at the thumb.</P>

    "There has not been anything the matter with it," went on Jean Valjean. </P>

    There was, in fact, no trace of any injury. </P>

    Jean Valjean continued: </P>

    "It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage. I absented myself as much as was in my power. So I invented this injury in order that I might not commit a forgery, that I might not introduce a flaw into the marriage documents, in order that I might escape from signing."</P>

    Marius stammered.</P>

    "What is the meaning of this?"</P>

    "The meaning of it is," replied Jean Valjean, "that I have been in the galleys."</P>

    "You are driving me mad!" exclaimed Marius in terror.</P>

    "Monsieur Pontmercy," said Jean Valjean, "I was nineteen years in the galleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for a second offence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban."</P>

    In vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, resist the evidence, he was forced to give way. He began to understand, and, as always happens in such cases, he understood too much. An inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him; an idea which made him quiver traversed his mind. He caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future.</P>

    "Say all, say all!" he cried. "You are Cosette's father!"</P>

    And he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable horror.</P>

    Jean Valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling.</P>

    "It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; although our oath to others may not be received in law . . ."</P>

    Here he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority, he added, articulating slowly, and emphasizing the syllables:</P>

    ". . . You will believe me. I the father of Cosette! Before God, no. Monsieur le Baron Pontmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles. I earned my living by pruning trees. My name is not Fauchelevent, but Jean Valjean. I am not related to Cosette. Reassure yourself."</P>

    Marius stammered:</P>

    "Who will prove that to me?"</P>

    "I.Since I tell you so."</P>

    Marius looked at the man. He was melancholy yet tranquil. No lie could proceed from such a calm. That which is icy is sincere. The truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb.</P>

    "I believe you," said Marius.</P>

    Jean Valjean bent his head, as though taking note of this, and continued:</P>

    "What am I to Cosette? A passer-by. Ten years ago, I did not know that she was in existence. I love her, it is true. One loves a child whom one has seen when very young, being old oneself. When one is old, one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children. You may, it seems to me, suppose that I have something which resembles a heart. She was an orphan. Without either father or mother. She needed me. That is why I began to love her. Children are so weak that the first comer, even a man like me, can become their protector. I have fulfilled this duty towards Cosette. I do not think that so slight a thing can be called a good action; but if it be a good action, well, say that I have done it. Register this attenuating circumstance. To-day, Cosette passes out of my life; our two roads part. Henceforth, I can do nothing for her. She is Madame Pontmercy. Her providence has changed. And Cosette gains by the change. All is well. As for the six hundred thousand francs, you do not mention them to me, but I forestall your thought, they are a deposit. How did that deposit come into my hands? What does that matter? I restore the deposit. Nothing more can be demanded of me. I complete the restitution by announcing my true name. That concerns me. I have a reason for desiring that you should know who I am."</P>

    And Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face.</P>

    All that Marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent. Certain gusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls.</P>

    We have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us is dispersed; we say the first things that occur to us, which are not always precisely those which should be said. There are sudden revelations which one cannot bear, and which intoxicate like baleful wine. Marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself to him, to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was angry with him for this avowal.</P>

    "But why," he exclaimed, "do you tell me all this? Who forces you to do so? You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neither denounced, nor tracked nor pursued. You have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation. Conclude. There is something more. In what connection do you make this confession? What is your motive?"</P>

    "My motive?" replied Jean Valjean in a voice so low and dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius. "From what motive, in fact, has this convict just said`I am a convict'? Well, yes! The motive is strange. It is out of honesty. Stay, the unfortunate point is that I have a thread in my heart, which keeps me fast. It is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly solid. All life falls in ruin around one; one resists. Had I been able to tear out that thread, to break it, to undo the knot or to cut it, to go far away, I should have been safe. I had only to go away; there are diligences in the Rue Bouloy; you are happy; I am going. I have tried to break that thread, I have jerked at it, it would not break, I tore my heart with it. Then I said:`I cannot live anywhere else than here.' I must stay. Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain here? You offer me a chamber in this house, Madame Pontmercy is sincerely attached to me, she said to the arm-chair:`Stretch out your arms to him,' your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me, I suit him, we shall live together, and take our meals in common, I shall give Cosette my arm . . . Madame Pontmercy, excuse me, it is a habit, we shall have but one roof, one table, one fire, the same chimney-corner in winter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy, that is happiness, that is everything. We shall live as one family. One family!"</P>

    At that word, Jean Valjean became wild. He folded his arms, glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein, and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones: </P>

    "As one family! No. I belong to no family. I do not belong to yours. I do not belong to any family of men. In houses where people are among themselves, I am superfluous. There are families, but there is nothing of the sort for me. I am an unlucky wretch; I am left outside. Did I have a father and mother? I almost doubt it. On the day when I gave that child in marriage, all came to an end. I have seen her happy, and that she is with a man whom she loves, and that there exists here a kind old man, a household of two angels, and all joys in that house, and that it was well, I said to myself:`Enter thou not.' I could have lied, it is true, have deceived you all, and remained Monsieur Fauchelevent. So long as it was for her, I could lie; but now it would be for myself, and I must not. It was sufficient for me to hold my peace, it is true, and all would go on. You ask me what has forced me to speak? a very odd thing; my conscience. To hold my peace was very easy, however. I passed the night in trying to persuade myself to it; you questioned me, and what I have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it; well, yes, I have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself, and I gave myself very good reasons, I have done what I could. But there are two things in which I have not succeeded; in breaking the thread that holds me fixed, riveted and sealed here by the heart, or in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when I am alone. That is why I have come hither to tell you everything this morning. Everything or nearly everything. It is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself; I keep that to myself. You know the essential points. So I have taken my mystery and have brought it to you. And I have disembowelled my secret before your eyes. It was not a resolution that was easy to take. I struggled all night long. Ah! You think that I did not tell myself that this was no Champmathieu affair, that by concealing my name I was doing no one any injury, that the name of Fauchelevent had been given to me by Fauchelevent himself, out of gratitude for a service rendered to him, and that I might assuredly keep it, and that I should be happy in that chamber which you offer me, that I should not be in any one's way, that I should be in my own little corner, and that, while you would have Cosette, I should have the idea that I was in the same house with her. Each one of us would have had his share of happiness. If I continued to be Monsieur Fauchelevent, that would arrange everything. Yes, with the exception of my soul. There was joy everywhere upon my surface, but the bottom of my soul remained black. It is not enough to be happy, one must be content. Thus I should have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thus I should have concealed my true visage, thus, in the presence of your expansion, I should have had an enigma, thus, in the midst of your full noonday, I should have had shadows, thus, without crying `'ware,' I should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who I was, you would drive me from it, I should have allowed myself to be served by domestics who, had they known, would have said: How horrible!' I should have touched you with my elbow, which you have a right to dislike, I should have filched your clasps of the hand! There would have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable white locks and tainted white locks; at your most intimate hours, when all hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest, when we four were together, your grandfather, you two and myself, a stranger would have been present! I should have been side by side with you in your existence, having for my only care not to disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit. Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust myself upon you who are living beings. I should have condemned her to myself forever. You and Cosette and I would have had all three of our heads in the green cap! Does it not make you shudder? I am only the most crushed of men; I should have been the most monstrous of men. And I should have committed that crime every day! And I should have had that face of night upon my visage every day! Every day! And I should have communicated to you a share in my taint every day! Every day! To you, my dearly beloved, my children, to you, my innocent creatures! Is it nothing to hold one's peace? Is it a simple matter to keep silence? No, it is not simple. There is a silence which lies. And my lie, and my fraud and my indignity, and my cowardice and my treason and my crime, I should have drained drop by drop, I should have spit it out, then swallowed it again, I should have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday, and my `good morning' would have lied, and my `good night' would have lied, and I should have slept on it, I should have eaten it, with my bread, and I should have looked Cosette in the face, and I should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul, and I should have been an abominable villain! Why should I do it? in order to be happy. In order to be happy. Have I the right to be happy? I stand outside of life, Sir."</P>

    Jean Valjean paused. Marius listened. Such chains of ideas and of anguishes cannot be interrupted. Jean Valjean lowered his voice once more, but it was no longer a dull voice--it was a sinister voice. </P>

    "You ask why I speak? I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked, you say. Yes! I am denounced! yes! I am tracked! By whom? By myself. It is I who bar the passage to myself, and I drag myself, and I push myself, and I arrest myself, and I execute myself, and when one holds oneself, one is firmly held."</P>

    And, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and extending it towards Marius: </P>

    "Do you see that fist?" he continued. "Don't you think that it holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it? Well! Conscience is another grasp! If one desires to be happy, sir, one must never understand duty; for, as soon as one has comprehended it, it is implacable. One would say that it punished you for comprehending it; but no, it rewards you; for it places you in a hell, where you feel God beside you. One has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at peace with himself."</P>

    And, with a poignant accent, he added:</P>

    "Monsieur Pontmercy, this is not common sense, I am an honest man. It is by degrading myself in your eyes that I elevate myself in my own. This has happened to me once before, but it was less painful then; it was a mere nothing. Yes, an honest man. I should not be so if, through my fault, you had continued to esteem me; now that you despise me, I am so. I have that fatality hanging over me that, not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration, that consideration humiliates me, and crushes me inwardly, and, in order that I may respect myself, it is necessary that I should be despised. Then I straighten up again. I am a galley-slave who obeys his conscience. I know well that that is most improbable. But what would you have me do about it? It is the fact. I have entered into engagements with myself; I keep them. There are encounters which bind us, there are chances which involve us in duties. You see, Monsieur Pontmercy, various things have happened to me in the course of my life." </P>

    Again Jean Valjean paused, swallowing his saliva with an effort, as though his words had a bitter after-taste, and then he went on: </P>

    "When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has not the right to make others share it without their knowledge, one has not the right to make them slip over one's own precipice without their perceiving it, one has not the right to let one's red blouse drag upon them, one has no right to slyly encumber with one's misery the happiness of others. It is hideous to approach those who are healthy, and to touch them in the dark with one's ulcer. In spite of the fact that Fauchelevent lent me his name, I have no right to use it; he could give it to me, but I could not take it. A name is an _I_. You see, sir, that I have thought somewhat, I have read a little, although I am a peasant; and you see that I express myself properly. I understand things. I have procured myself an education. Well, yes, to abstract a name and to place oneself under it is dishonest. Letters of the alphabet can be filched, like a purse or a watch. To be a false signature in flesh and blood, to be a living false key, to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock, never more to look straightforward, to forever eye askance, to be infamous within the _I_, no! No! No! No! No! It is better to suffer, to bleed, to weep, to tear one's skin from the flesh with one's nails, to pass nights writhing in anguish, to devour oneself body and soul. That is why I have just told you all this. Wantonly, as you say."</P>

    He drew a painful breath, and hurled this final word:</P>

    "In days gone by, I stole a loaf of bread in order to live; to-day, in order to live, I will not steal a name." </P>

    "To live!" interrupted Marius. "You do not need that name in order to live?"</P>

    "Ah! I understand the matter," said Jean Valjean, raising and lowering his head several times in succession. </P>

    A silence ensued. Both held their peace, each plunged in a gulf of thoughts. Marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his mouth on one of his fingers, which was folded back. Jean Valjean was pacing to and fro. He paused before a mirror, and remained motionless. Then, as though replying to some inward course of reasoning, he said, as he gazed at the mirror, which he did not see:</P>

    "While, at present, I am relieved."</P>

    He took up his march again, and walked to the other end of the drawing-room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived that Marius was watching his walk. Then he said, with an inexpressible intonation: </P>

    "I drag my leg a little. Now you understand why!"</P>

    Then he turned fully round towards Marius:</P>

    "And now, sir, imagine this:I have said nothing, I have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, I have taken my place in your house, I am one of you, I am in my chamber, I come to breakfast in the morning in slippers, in the evening all three of us go to the play, I accompany Madame Pontmercy to the Tuileries, and to the Place Royale, we are together, you think me your equal; one fine day you are there, and I am there, we are conversing, we are laughing; all at once, you hear a voice shouting this name: Jean Valjean!' and behold, that terrible hand, the police, darts from the darkness, and abruptly tears off my mask!"</P>

    Again he paused; Marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder. Jean Valjean resumed:</P>

    "What do you say to that?"</P>

    Marius' silence answered for him.</P>

    Jean Valjean continued:</P>

    "You see that I am right in not holding my peace. Be happy, be in heaven, be the angel of an angel, exist in the sun, be content therewith, and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth; you have before you, sir, a wretched man."</P>

    Marius slowly crossed the room, and, when he was quite close to Jean Valjean, he offered the latter his hand. </P>

    But Marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not offered, Jean Valjean let him have his own way, and it seemed to Marius that he pressed a hand of marble.</P>

    "My grandfather has friends," said Marius; "I will procure your pardon."</P>

    "It is useless," replied Jean Valjean. "I am believed to be dead, and that suffices. The dead are not subjected to surveillance. They are supposed to rot in peace. Death is the same thing as pardon."</P>

    And, disengaging the hand which Marius held, he added, with a sort of inexorable dignity:</P>

    "Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty; and I need but one pardon, that of my conscience." </P>

    At that moment, a door at the other end of the drawing-room opened gently half way, and in the opening Cosette's head appeared. They saw only her sweet face, her hair was in charming disorder, her eyelids were still swollen with sleep. She made the movement of a bird, which thrusts its head out of its nest, glanced first at her husband, then at Jean Valjean, and cried to them with a smile, so that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of a rose:</P>

    "I will wager that you are talking politics. How stupid that is, instead of being with me!"</P>

    Jean Valjean shuddered.</P>

    "Cosette! . . ." stammered Marius.</P>

    And he paused. One would have said that they were two criminals.</P>

    Cosette, who was radiant, continued to gaze at both of them. There was something in her eyes like gleams of paradise. </P>

    "I have caught you in the very act," said Cosette. "Just now, I heard my father Fauchelevent through the door saying: `Conscience . . . doing my duty . . .' That is politics, indeed it is. I will not have it. People should not talk politics the very next day. It is not right."</P>

    "You are mistaken. Cosette," said Marius,"we are talking business. We are discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs . . ."</P>

    "That is not it at all " interrupted Cosette. "I am coming. Does any body want me here?" </P>

    And, passing resolutely through the door, she entered the drawing-room.She was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown, with a thousand folds and large sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to her feet. In the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures, there are these charming sacks fit to clothe the angels.</P>

    She contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror, then exclaimed, in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy: </P>

    "There was once a King and a Queen. Oh! How happy I am!"</P>

    That said, she made a curtsey to Marius and to Jean Valjean.</P>

    "There," said she, "I am going to install myself near you in an easy-chair, we breakfast in half an hour, you shall say anything you like, I know well that men must talk, and I will be very good." </P>

    Marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her:</P>

    "We are talking business."</P>

    "By the way," said Cosette, "I have opened my window, a flock of pierrots has arrived in the garden,--Birds, not maskers. To-day is Ash-Wednesday; but not for the birds."</P>

    "I tell you that we are talking business, go, my little Cosette, leave us alone for a moment. We are talking figures. That will bore you."</P>

    "You have a charming cravat on this morning, Marius. You are very dandified, monseigneur. No, it will not bore me." </P>

    "I assure you that it will bore you."</P>

    "No. Since it is you. I shall not understand you, but I shall listen to you. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, one does not need to understand the words that they utter. That we should be here together--that is all that I desire. I shall remain with you, bah!"</P>

    "You are my beloved Cosette! Impossible."</P>

    "Impossible!"</P>

    "Yes."</P>

    "Very good," said Cosette. "I was going to tell you some news. I could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep, that your aunt is at mass, that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent's room smokes, that Nicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep, that Toussaint and Nicolette have already quarrelled, that Nicolette makes sport of Toussaint's stammer. Well, you shall know nothing. Ah! It is impossible? You shall see, gentlemen, that I, in my turn, can say: It is impossible. Then who will be caught? I beseech you, my little Marius, let me stay here with you two."</P>

    "I swear to you, that it is indispensable that we should be alone."</P>

    "Well, am I anybody?"</P>

    Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word. Cosette turned to him:</P>

    "In the first place, father, I want you to come and embrace me. What do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part? Who gave me such a father as that? You must perceive that my family life is very unhappy. My husband beats me. Come, embrace me instantly."</P>

    Jean Valjean approached.</P>

    Cosette turned toward Marius.</P>

    "As for you, I shall make a face at you."</P>

    Then she presented her brow to Jean Valjean.</P>

    Jean Valjean advanced a step toward her.</P>

    Cosette recoiled.</P>

    "Father, you are pale. Does your arm hurt you?"</P>

    "It is well," said Jean Valjean.</P>

    "Did you sleep badly?"</P>

    "No."</P>

    "Are you sad?"</P>

    "No."</P>

    "Embrace me if you are well, if you sleep well, if you are content, I will not scold you." </P>

    And again she offered him her brow.</P>

    Jean Valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestial gleam.</P>

    "Smile."</P>

    Jean Valjean obeyed. It was the smile of a spectre.</P>

    "Now, defend me against my husband."</P>

    "Cosette! . . ." ejaculated Marius.</P>

    "Get angry, father. Say that I must stay. You can certainly talk before me. So you think me very silly. What you say is astonishing! Business, placing money in a bank a great matter truly. Men make mysteries out of nothing. I am very pretty this morning. Look at me, Marius."</P>

    And with an adorable shrug of the shoulders, and an indescribably exquisite pout, she glanced at Marius. </P>

    "I love you!" said Marius.</P>

    "I adore you!" said Cosette.</P>

    And they fell irresistibly into each other's arms.</P>

    "Now," said Cosette, adjusting a fold of her dressing-gown, with a triumphant little grimace, "I shall stay."</P>

    "No, not that," said Marius, in a supplicating tone. "We have to finish something."</P>

    "Still no?"</P>

    Marius assumed a grave tone:</P>

    "I assure you, Cosette, that it is impossible."</P>

    "Ah! you put on your man's voice, sir. That is well, I go. You, father, have not upheld me. Monsieur my father, monsieur my husband, you are tyrants. I shall go and tell grandpapa. If you think that I am going to return and talk platitudes to you, you are mistaken. I am proud. I shall wait for you now. You shall see, that it is you who are going to be bored without me. I am going, it is well."</P>

    And she left the room.</P>

    Two seconds later, the door opened once more, her fresh and rosy head was again thrust between the two leaves, and she cried to them: </P>

    "I am very angry indeed."</P>

    The door closed again, and the shadows descended once more.</P>

    It was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the night, without itself being conscious of it. </P>

    Marius made sure that the door was securely closed.</P>

    "Poor Cosette!" he murmured, "when she finds out . . ."</P>

    At that word Jean Valjean trembled in every limb. He fixed on Marius a bewildered eye. </P>

    "Cosette! oh yes, it is true, you are going to tell Cosette about this. That is right. Stay, I had not thought of that. One has the strength for one thing, but not for another. Sir, I conjure you, I entreat now, sir, give me your most sacred word of honor, that you will not tell her. Is it not enough that you should know it? I have been able to say it myself without being forced to it, I could have told it to the universe, to the whole world,--it was all one to me. But she, she does not know what it is, it would terrify her. What, a convict! we should be obliged to explain matters to her, to say to her: `He is a man who has been in the galleys.' She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh! My God!" . . . He dropped into an arm-chair and hid his face in his hands. </P>

    His grief was not audible, but from the quivering of his shoulders it was evident that he was weeping. Silent tears, terrible tears. </P>

    There is something of suffocation in the sob. He was seized with a sort of convulsion, he threw himself against the back of the chair as though to gain breath, letting his arms fall, and allowing Marius to see his face inundated with tears, and Marius heard him murmur, so low that his voice seemed to issue from fathomless depths:</P>

    "Oh! would that I could die!"</P>

    "Be at your ease," said Marius, "I will keep your secret for myself alone." x And, less touched, perhaps, than he ought to have been, but forced, for the last hour, to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was dreadful, gradually beholding the convict superposed before his very eyes, upon M. Fauchelevent, overcome, little by little, by that lugubrious reality, and led, by the natural inclination of the situation, to recognize the space which had just been placed between that man and himself, Marius added: </P>

    "It is impossible that I should not speak a word to you with regard to the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted. That is an act of probity. It is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you. Fix the sum yourself, it shall be counted out to you. Do not fear to set it very high."</P>

    "I thank you, sir," replied Jean Valjean, gently.</P>

    He remained in thought for a moment, mechanically passing the tip of his fore-finger across his thumb-nail, then he lifted up his voice: </P>

    "All is nearly over. But one last thing remains for me . . ."</P>

    "What is it?"</P>

    Jean Valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation, and, without voice, without breath, he stammered rather than said: </P>

    "Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, that I ought not to see Cosette any more?" </P>

    "I think that would be better," replied Marius coldly.</P>

    "I shall never see her more," murmured Jean Valjean. And he directed his steps towards the door.</P>

    He laid his hand on the knob, the latch yielded, the door opened. Jean Valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through, stood motionless for a second, then closed the door again and turned to Marius. </P>

    He was no longer pale, he was livid. There were no longer any tears in his eyes, but only a sort of tragic flame. His voice had regained a strange c omposure.</P>

    "Stay, sir," he said. "If you will allow it, I will come to see her. I assure you that I desire it greatly. If I had not cared to see Cosette, I should not have made to you the confession that I have made, I should have gone away; but, as I desired to remain in the place where Cosette is, and to continue to see her, I had to tell you about it honestly. You follow my reasoning, do you not? It is a matter easily understood. You see, I have had her with me for more than nine years. We lived first in that hut on the boulevard, then in the convent, then near the Luxembourg. That was where you saw her for the first time. You remember her blue plush hat. Then we went to the Quartier des Invalides, where there was a railing on a garden, the Rue Plumet. I lived in a little back court-yard, whence I could hear her piano. That was my life. We never left each other. That lasted for nine years and some months. I was like her own father, and she was my child. I do not know whether you understand, Monsieur Pontmercy, but to go away now, never to see her again, never to speak to her again, to no longer have anything, would be hard. If you do not disapprove of it, I will come to see Cosette from time to time. I will not come often. I will not remain long. You shall give orders that I am to be received in the little waiting-room. On the ground floor. I could enter perfectly well by the back door, but that might create surprise perhaps, and it would be better, I think, for me to enter by the usual door. Truly, sir, I should like to see a little more of Cosette. As rarely as you please. Put yourself in my place, I have nothing left but that. And then, we must be cautious. If I no longer come at all, it would produce a bad effect, it would be considered singular. What I can do, by the way, is to come in the afternoon, when night is beginning to fall."</P>

    "You shall come every evening," said Marius, "and Cosette will be waiting for you."</P>

    "You are kind, sir," said Jean Valjean.</P>

    Marius saluted Jean Valjean, happiness escorted despair to the door, and these two men parted.</P>

    婚礼的第二天是静悄悄的，大家尊重幸福的人，让他们单独在一起，也让他们稍迟一点起身。来访和祝贺的喧闹声稍后一点才会开始。二月十七日，中午稍过，当巴斯克臂下夹着抹布和鸡毛掸，正忙着打扫“他的候客室”时，他听见轻轻的敲门声。没有按门铃，在当天这样做是知趣的。巴斯克打开门，见到割风先生。他把他引进客厅，那里东西都零乱地堆放着，就象是咋晚快乐节日后的战场。</P>

    “天哪，先生，”巴斯克注意到了，“我们都起迟了。”</P>

    “你的主人起床了没有？”冉阿让问。</P>

    “先生的手好了没有？”巴斯克回答。</P>

    “好些了，你的主人起床了吗？”</P>

    “哪一位？老的还是新的？”</P>

    “彭眉胥先生。”</P>

    “男爵先生？”巴斯克站直了身子说。</P>

    身为男爵主要是在他仆人的眼里，有些东西是属于他们的；哲学家称他们为沾头衔之光者，这一点使他们得意。马吕斯，我们顺便提一下，是共和国的战士，他已证实了这一点，现在则违反他的心愿成了男爵。家里曾为这个头衔发生过一次小小的革命；而现在却是吉诺曼先生坚持这点了，马吕斯倒满不在乎。不过彭眉胥上校曾留过话：“吾儿应承袭我的勋位。”马吕斯服从了。还有珂赛特，她已开始成为主妇，也很乐意做男爵夫人。</P>

    “男爵先生？”巴斯克又说，“我去看看。我去告诉他割风先生来了。”</P>

    “不，不要告诉他是我，告诉他有人要求和他个别谈话，不用说出姓名。”</P>

    “啊！”巴斯克说。</P>

    “我要使他感到出其不意。”</P>

    巴斯克又“啊”了一下。第二个“啊”是他对第一个“啊”的解释。</P>

    于是他走了出去。</P>

    冉阿让独自留在客厅里。</P>

    这个客厅，我们刚才说过，还是乱七八糟的。仔细去听时好象还能隐约听到婚礼的喧哗声。地板上有各种各样的从花环和头上掉下来的花朵。燃烧到头的蜡烛在水晶吊灯上增添了蜡制的钟乳石。没有一件木器摆在原来的地方。在几个角落里，三四把靠近的椅子围成一圈，好象有人还在继续谈天。总的情况看起来还是欢乐的。已过去了的节日，还留下了某种美感。这些都曾是快乐的。在拖乱了的椅子上，在开始枯萎的花朵中，在熄了的灯光下，大家曾想到过欢乐。继吊灯的光辉之后太阳兴高采烈地进入客厅。</P>

    几分钟过去了。冉阿让没有动，仍呆在巴斯克离去时的地方。他脸色惨白。他的眼睛因失眠陷进眼眶，几乎看不见了。他的黑色服装现出穿了过夜的皱纹，手肘处沾着呢子和垫单磨擦后起的白色绒毛。冉阿让望着脚边地板上太阳画出来的窗框。</P>

    门口发出了声音，他便抬头望。</P>

    马吕斯进来了，高昂着头，嘴上带着笑，脸上有着无法形容的光彩，满面春风，目光里充满了胜利的喜悦，原来他也没有睡觉。</P>

    “是您呀，父亲！”他看见冉阿让时这样叫道，“这个傻瓜巴斯克一副神秘的样子！您来得太早了，刚十二点半，珂赛特还在睡觉呢！”</P>

    马吕斯称割风先生“父亲”的意思是“无比的幸福”。我们知道，在他们之间一直存在着隔阂、冷淡和拘束，存在着要打碎的或融化的冰块。马吕斯陶醉的程度已使隔阂消失，冰雪融化，使他和珂赛特一样把割风先生当作父亲来看待了。</P>

    他继续说着，心中冒出说不完的话，这正是圣洁的极度欢乐所应有的表现：</P>

    “我真高兴见到您！您不知道昨天我们因您不在而感到多么遗憾！早安，父亲。您的手怎么样了？好些了，是吗？”</P>

    于是很满意他对自己作出的好的回答，他又继续说：</P>

    “我们俩一直在谈您。珂赛特非常爱您！您不要忘记这里有您的寝室。我们不再需要武人街了，我们真不再需要了。您当初怎么会去住在那样一条街上？它是有病的，愁眉苦脸的，丑陋不堪，一头还有一道栅栏，那里又冷，简直进不去。您来住在这里，今天就来。否则珂赛特要找您算账。我预先通知您，她是准备牵着我们大家的鼻子跟她走的。您看见您的寝室了，它紧挨着我们的房间，窗子向着花园；已经叫人把门上的锁修好了，床也铺好了，房间都整理好了，您只要来住就行了。珂赛特在您的床前放了一张乌德勒支丝绒的老圈手椅，她向它说：‘你伸开两臂迎接他。’每年春天，在您窗前刺槐的花丛里会飞来一只黄莺。两个月以后您就能见到它了。它的巢在您的左边，而我们的窝则在您的右边。晚上它来歌唱，白天有珂赛特的语声。您的房间朝着正南方向。珂赛特会把您的书放在那里，您的《库克将军旅行记》，还有另一本旺古费写的旅行记，以及所有您的东西。我想，还有一只您所珍视的小提箱，我已给它选定了一个体面的角落。您得到了我外祖父的赞赏，您和他谈得来。我们将一起共同生活。您会打惠斯特纸牌吗？您会打惠斯特就更使外祖父喜出望外了。我到法院去的日子，您就带珂赛特去散步，让她搀着您的手臂，您知道，就和从前在卢森堡公园时一样。我们完全决定了要过得十分幸福。而您也来分享我们的幸福，听见吗？父亲？啊，您今天和我们一起进早餐吧？”</P>

    “先生，”冉阿让说，“我有一件事要告诉您。我过去是一个苦役犯。”</P>

    耳朵听到的尖音有一个对思想和耳朵都可以超过的限度。这几个字“我过去是一个苦役犯”，从冉阿让口中出来，进入马吕斯的耳中，是超出了听到的可能。马吕斯听不见。他觉得有人向他说了话；但他不知道说了些什么，他呆住了。</P>

    此刻他才发现，和他说话的人神情骇人，他激动的心情使他直到目前才发现这可怕的惨白面色。</P>

    冉阿让解去吊着右手的黑领带，去掉包手的布，把大拇指露出来给马吕斯看。</P>

    “我手上什么伤也没有。”他说。</P>

    马吕斯看了看大拇指。</P>

    “我什么也不曾有过。”冉阿让又说。</P>

    手指上的确一点伤痕也没有。</P>

    冉阿让继续说：</P>

    “你们的婚礼我不到比较恰当，我尽量做到不在场，我假装受了伤，为了避免作假，避免在婚书上加上无效的东西，为了避免签字。”</P>

    马吕斯结结巴巴地说：“这是什么意思？”</P>

    “意思是说，”冉阿让回答，“我曾被罚，干过苦役。”</P>

    “您真使我发疯！”马吕斯恐怖地喊起来。</P>

    “彭眉胥先生，”冉阿让说，“我曾在苦役场呆过十九年，因为偷盗。后来我被判处无期徒刑，为了偷盗，也为了重犯。目前，我是一个违反放逐令的人。”</P>

    马吕斯想逃避事实，否认这件事，拒绝明显的实情，但都无济于事，结果他被迫屈服。他开始懂了，但他又懂得过了分，在这种情况下总是这样的。他心头感到丑恶的一闪现；一个使他颤抖的念头，在他的脑中掠过。他隐约看到他未来的命运是丑恶的。</P>

    “把一切都说出来，全说出来！”他叫着，“您是珂赛特的父亲！”</P>

    于是他向后退了两步，表现出无法形容的厌恶。</P>

    冉阿让抬起头，态度如此尊严，似乎高大得顶到了天花板。</P>

    “您必须相信这一点，先生，虽然我们这种人的誓言，法律是不承认的……”</P>

    这时他静默了一下，于是他用一种至高无上而又阴沉的权威口气慢慢地说下去，吐清每一个字，重重地发出每一个音节：</P>

    “……您要相信我。珂赛特的父亲，我！在上帝面前发誓，不是的，彭眉胥先生，我是法维洛勒地方的农民。我靠修树枝维持生活。我的名字不是割风，我叫冉阿让。我与珂赛特毫无关系。您放心吧。”</P>

    马吕斯含糊地说：</P>

    “谁能向我证明？……”</P>

    “我，既然我这样说。”</P>

    马吕斯望着这个人，他神情沉痛而平静，如此平静的人不可能撒谎。冰冷的东西是诚挚的。在这墓穴般的寒冷中使人感到有着真实的东西。</P>

    “我相信您。”马吕斯说。</P>

    冉阿让点一下头好象表示知道了，又继续说：</P>

    “我是珂赛特的什么人？一个过路人。十年前，我不知道她的存在。我疼她，这是事实。自己老了，看着一个孩子从小长大，是会爱这个孩子的。一个人老了，觉得自己是所有孩子的祖父。我认为，您能这样去想，我还有一颗类似心一样的东西。她是没有父母的孤儿，她需要我。这就是为什么我爱她的原因。孩子是如此软弱，任何一个人，即使象我这样的人，也会做他们的保护人。我对珂赛特尽到了保护人的责任。我并不认为这一点小事当真可以称作善事；但如果是善事，那就算我做了吧。请您记下这一件可以减罪的事。今天珂赛特离开了我的生活；我们开始分道。从今以后我和她毫无关系了。她是彭眉胥夫人。她的靠山已换了人。这一替换对她有利。一切如意。至于那六十万法郎，您不向我提这件事，我比您抢先想到，那是一笔托我保管的钱。那笔款子为什么会在我手中？这有什么关系？我归还这笔款子。别人不能对我有更多的要求。我交出这笔钱并且说出我的真姓名。这是我的事，我本人要您知道我是什么人。”</P>

    于是冉阿让正视着马吕斯。</P>

    马吕斯此刻的感觉是心乱如麻，茫无头绪。命运里有些狂风会引起心里这样汹涌澎湃的波涛。</P>

    我们大家都经历过这种内心极其混乱的时刻，我们说的是头脑里首先想到的话，这些话不一定是真的应该说的。有些突然泄露的事使人承受不了，它好象毒酒，使人昏迷。马吕斯被新出现的情况惊得不知所措，他在说话时甚至象在责怪这人暴露了真情。</P>

    “您究竟为什么要向我说这些话呢？”他叫喊着，“什么原因在强迫您说？您尽可以自己保留这个秘密。您既没有被告发，也没有被跟踪，也没有被追捕？您乐意来泄露这事总有个理由，说完它，还有其他的事。根据什么理由您要承认这件事？</P>

    为了什么原因？”</P>

    “为了什么原因？”冉阿让回答的声音如此低沉而微弱，好象在自言自语而不是在向马吕斯说话。“不错，为了什么原因，这个苦役犯要来说：‘我是一个苦役犯？’是呀！这个原因是很奇怪的，这是为了诚实。您看，最痛苦不过的是有根线牵住了我的心。尤其在人老了的时候，这些线就特别结实，生命四周的一切都可毁掉，而这线却牢不可断。如果我能拔掉这根线，将它拉断，解开或者切除疙瘩，远远地走开，我就可以得救，只要离开就行了；在布洛亚街就有公共马车；你们幸福了，我走了。我也曾设法把线拉断，我抽着，但它却牢不可断，我连心都快拔出来了。于是我说：‘我只有不离开这里才能活下去，我必须待在这里。’真就是这样，您有理，我是一个蠢人，为什么不简简单单地待下来？您在您的家里给了我一间寝室，彭眉胥夫人很爱我，她向这只沙发说：‘伸开两臂迎接他。’您的外祖父巴不得我来陪伴他，他和我合得来，我们大家住在一起，同桌吃饭，珂赛特挽着我的手臂……彭眉胥夫人，请原谅，我叫惯了，我们在一个屋顶下，同桌吃饭，共用一炉火，冬天我们围炉取暖，夏天仍去散步，这些都是何等愉快，何等幸福，这些就是一切。我们同住象一家人一样。一家人！”</P>

    提到这两个字，冉阿让变得怕和人交往的样子，他叉起双臂，眼睛盯着脚下的地板，好象要挖一个地洞，他的声音忽然响亮起来了：</P>

    “一家人！不可能，我没有家，我，我不是你们家里的人。我不属于人类的家庭。在家庭的生活中我是多余的，世上有的是家，但不是我的。我是不幸的人，流离失所的人。我是否有过一个父亲或一个母亲？我几乎怀疑这一点。我把这孩子嫁出去的那天，一切就结束了，我看到她幸福并和她心爱的人在一起，这里有一个慈祥的老人，一对天使共同生活，幸福美满，一切称心如意了，于是我对自己说：‘你，可不要进去。’我可以说谎，不错，来瞒着你们所有的人，仍旧当割风先生。只要为了她，我就能说谎；但现在是为了我自己，我不该这样做。不错，我只要不说，一切就会照旧，你问我是什么理由迫使我说出来？一个怪理由，就是我的良心。不泄露其实很容易。我曾整夜这样来说服我自己；您让我说出秘密，而我来向您说的事是如此不寻常，您确实有权让我说；真的，我曾整夜给自己找理由，我也给自己找到了很充足的理由，是的，我已尽我所能。但有两件事我没有做到：我既没有把牵住我、钉住我、封住我的心的线割断，又没有，当我一人独处时，让那轻声向我说话的人住口。因此我今早来向您承认一切。一切，或者几乎就是一切。还有一些是不相干的，只涉及我个人的，我就保留下来了。主要的您已知道。因此我把我的秘密交给您，在您面前我说出我的秘密，这并不是一个容易下的决心。我斗争了一整夜，啊！您以为我没有向自己解释这并不是商马第事件，隐瞒我的姓名无损于人，并且割风这个名字是割风为了报恩而亲自送给我的，我完全可以保留它，我在您给我的房中可以过得愉快，我不会碍事，我将待在我的角落里，您有珂赛特，我也感到自己和她同住在一所房子里。每个人都有自己恰如其分的一份幸福，继续做割风先生，这样一切问题都解决了。不错，除了我的良心，到处使我感到快乐，但我心灵深处仍是黑暗的。这样的幸福是不够的，要自己感到满意才行。我这样仍旧当割风先生，我的真面目就隐藏起来了，而在你们心花怒放的时候，我心里藏着一件暧昧的事，在你们的光明磊落中，我还有着我的黑暗；这样，不预先警告，我就径自把徒刑监狱引进了你们的家，我和你们同桌坐着，心中暗自思量，如果你们知道我是谁，一定要把我赶出大门，我让仆从侍候着我，如果他们知道了，一定会叫：‘多么可怕呀！’我把手肘碰着您，而您是有权拒绝的，我可以骗到和你们握手！在你们家里，可敬的白发老人和可耻的白发老人将分享你们的敬重；在你们最亲切的时候，当人人都以为相互都已把心完全敞开，当我们四个人一起的时候，在您的外祖父、你们俩和我之中，就有一个是陌生人！我将和你们在一起共同生活，同时一心想的是不要把我那可怕的井盖揭开。这样我会把我这个死人强加给你们这些活人，我将终身被判过这种生活。您、珂赛特和我，我们三个人将同戴一顶绿帽子！你难道不发抖吗？我只是众人里一个被压得最低的人，因而也就是一个最凶狠的人。而这罪行，我将每日重犯！这一欺骗，我则每日重复！这个黑暗的面具，我每天都要戴着！我的耻辱，每天都要使你们担负一部分！每天！使你们，我亲爱的，我的孩子，我的纯洁的人来负担！隐瞒不算一回事？缄默是容易办到的吗？不，这并不简单。有的缄默等于撒谎。我的谎言，我的假冒的行为，我的不适当的地位，我的无耻，我的背叛，我的罪恶，我将一滴一滴地吞下肚去，吐了又吞，到半夜吞完，中午又重新开始，我说的早安是种欺骗，我说的晚安也会是种欺骗，我将睡在这上面，和着面包吞下去，我将面对珂赛特，我将用囚犯的微笑回答天使的微笑，那我将会是一个万恶的骗子！为了什么目的？为了得到幸福。为了得到幸福，为自己！难道我有权利得到幸福？我是处于生活之外的人啊，先生。”</P>

    冉阿让停了下来。马吕斯听着。象这样连贯的思想和悲痛是不能中断的。冉阿让又重新放低语调，但这已不是低沉的声音，而是死气沉沉的声音：</P>

    “您问我为什么要说出来？您说我既没有被告发，也没有被跟踪，也没有被追捕。是的，我是被告发了！是的！被跟踪和被追捕了！被谁？被我自己。是我挡住我自己的去路，我自己拖着自己，我自己推着，我自己逮捕自己，我自己执行，当一个人自己捉住自己时，那就是真捉住了。”</P>

    于是他一把抓住自己的衣服朝马吕斯靠去：</P>

    “您看这个拳头，”他继续说，“您不觉得它揪住这领子是不打算放掉的？好吧！良心完全是另一种拳头呀！如果要做幸福的人，先生，那就永远不应懂得天职，因为，一旦懂得了，它就是铁面无私的。似乎它因为你懂了而惩罚你；不对，它为此而酬报；因为它把你放进一个地狱里去，在那里你感到上帝就在你身旁。剖腹开膛的惩罚刚要结束，自己和自己之间就相安无事了。”</P>

    于是他用一种痛心而强调的语气继续说：</P>

    “彭眉胥先生，这不合乎常情，我是一个诚实的人。我在您眼里贬低自己，才能在自己眼里抬高自己。我已碰到过一次这样的事，但没有这样沉痛；那不算什么。是的，一个诚实人。如果因我的过错，您还继续尊敬我，那我就不是诚实的人；现在您鄙视我，我才是诚实的。我的命运注定了只能得到骗来的尊重，这种尊重使我内心自卑，并徒增内疚，因此要我自尊，就得受别人的蔑视。这样我才能重新站起来。我是一个不违反良心的苦役犯。我知道这很难使人相信。但我又有什么办法？就是这样。我自己向自己许下诺言；我履行诺言。一些相遇把我们拴住，一些偶然事件使我们负起责任。您看，彭眉胥先生，我一生中遇到的事真是不少啊。”</P>

    冉阿让又停顿了一下，用力咽下口水，好象他的话里有一种苦的回味，他又继续说下去：</P>

    “当一个人有这样骇人的事在身上时，就无权去瞒人而使别人来共同分担，无权把瘟疫传给别人，无权使别人在一无所知的情况下从他的绝壁往下滑，无权使自己的红帽子①去拖累别人，无权暗中使自己的苦难成为别人幸福的拖累。走近健康的人，暗中把自己看不见的痈疽去碰触别人，这是多么的卑鄙。割风尽管把姓名借给我，我可无权使用；他能给我，我可不能占有。一个名字，是代表本人的。您看，先生，我动了一下脑筋，我读过一点书，虽然我是一个农民；大道理我还能懂得。您看我的言辞还算得体。我自己教育过自己。是啊！诈取一个名字，据为己有，这是不诚实的。字母也象钱包或怀表一样可以被盗。签一个活着的假名，做一个活的假钥匙，撬开锁进入诚实人的家，永不能昂首正视，永远得斜着眼偷看，自己心里真感到耻辱，不行！不行！不行！不行！我宁愿受苦，流血，痛哭，自己用指甲剥下肉上的皮，整夜在痛苦中扭捩打滚，折磨心胸。这就是我来向您讲明这一切的原因，正象您所说的，乐意这样做。” </P>

    ①死囚戴红帽子。</P>

    他困难地喘着气，并且吐出了最后一句话：</P>

    “过去，为了活命，我偷了一块面包；今天，为了活命，我不盗窃名字。”</P>

    “为了活命！”马吕斯打断他的话，“您不需要这个名字了？</P>

    为了活命。”</P>

    “啊！我懂得自己的意思了。”冉阿让缓慢地连续几次抬起了头又低了下去。</P>

    一阵沉默。两人都默默无言，各人都沉浸在思想深处。马吕斯坐在桌旁，屈着一指托住嘴角，冉阿让来回踱着，他停在一面镜子前不动，于是，好象在回答心里的推理，他望着镜子但没有看见自己说道：</P>

    “只是现在我才如释重负！”</P>

    他又开始走，走到客厅的另一头，他回头时发现马吕斯在注视着他走路，于是他用一种无法形容的语气对他说：</P>

    “我有点拖着步子走路。您现在知道是什么原因了。”</P>

    然后他完全转向马吕斯：</P>

    “现在，先生，您请想象一下，我仍是割风先生，我在您家里待下去，我是您家里的人，我在我的寝室里，早晨我穿着拖鞋来进早餐，晚上我们三个人去看戏，我陪彭眉胥夫人到杜伊勒里宫和王宫广场去散步，我们在一起，你们以为我是你们一样的人；有那么一天，我在这儿，你们也在，大家谈天说笑，忽然，你们听见一个声音，叫着这个名字：‘冉阿让！’于是警察这只可怕的手从黑暗中伸出来，突然把我的假面具扯掉了！”</P>

    他又沉默了；马吕斯战栗着站了起来，冉阿让又说：</P>

    “您觉得怎么样？”</P>

    马吕斯用沉默作回答。</P>

    冉阿让接着说：</P>

    “您看，我没有保持沉默是对的。好好地继续过你们幸福的生活吧！好象在天堂里一样，做一个天使的天使，生活在灿烂的阳光中，请对此感到满足，不要去管一个可怜的受苦人是以什么方式向您开诚布公和尽他的责任的。在您面前是一个悲惨的人，先生。”</P>

    马吕斯慢慢地在客厅中穿过，当他走近冉阿让时，向他伸出手来。</P>

    但马吕斯是不得不去握那只不向他伸出的手的，冉阿让听凭他握，马吕斯觉得好象握着一只大理石的手。</P>

    “我的外祖父有些朋友，”马吕斯说，“我将设法使您获得赦免。”</P>

    “无济于事，”冉阿让回答，“别人认为我已死去。这已足够了。死了的人不会再被监视。他们被认为是在静静地腐烂着。</P>

    死了，等于是赦免了。”</P>

    于是，他把马吕斯握着的手收回来，用一种严酷的自尊语气补充了一句：</P>

    “此外，尽我的天职，这就是我要向它求救的那个朋友；我只需要一种赦免，那就是我自己良心的赦免。”</P>

    这时，在客厅的那一头，门慢慢地开了一半，在半开的门里露出了珂赛特的头。人们只看到她可爱的面容，头发蓬松，很好看，眼皮还带着睡意。她做了一个小鸟把头伸出鸟巢的动作，先看看她的丈夫，再看看冉阿让，她笑着向他们大声说着，好象是玫瑰花心里的一个微笑：</P>

    “我打赌你们在谈政治！真傻，不和我在一起！”</P>

    冉阿让打了一个寒噤。</P>

    “珂赛特！……”马吕斯吞吞吐吐。接着他停住了。在别人看来好象两个有罪的人。</P>

    珂赛特，兴高采烈地继续来回地看着他们两人。她的眼里象是闪耀着天堂里的欢乐。</P>

    “我当场抓住你们了，”珂赛特说，“我刚从门外听见我父亲割风说：‘良心……尽他的天职……’这是政治呀，这些。我不爱听。不该第二天就谈政治，这是不公正的。”</P>

    “你弄错了，珂赛特，”马吕斯说，“我们在谈生意。我们在谈你的六十万法郎存放在什么地方最好……”</P>

    “还有别的，”珂赛特打断他的话，“我来了，你们这里要我来吗？”</P>

    她干脆走进门，到了客厅里。她穿着一件白色宽袖百褶晨衣，从颈部一直下垂到脚跟。在那种天上金光闪耀的古老的哥特式油画中，有着这种可以放进一个天使的美丽的宽大衣裳。</P>

    她在一面大穿衣镜前从头至脚地注视自己，然后突然用无法形容的狂喜声调大声说：</P>

    “从前有一个国王和一个王后。啊！我太高兴了！”</P>

    说完这句话，她向马吕斯和冉阿让行了一个屈膝礼。</P>

    “就是这样，”她说，“我来坐在你们身旁的沙发椅上，再过半小时就进早餐了，你们尽管谈你们的，我知道男人们是有话要说的，我会乖乖地待着。”</P>

    马吕斯挽着她的手臂亲热地向她说：</P>

    “我们在谈生意。”</P>

    “想起了一件事，”珂赛特回答，“我刚才把窗子打开了，有很多小丑到花园里来了。都是些小鸟，不戴面具。今天是斋期开始，可是小鸟不吃斋呀！”</P>

    “我告诉你我们在谈生意，去吧，我亲爱的珂赛特，让我们再谈一下，我们在谈数字，你听了会厌烦的。”</P>

    “你今天打了一个漂亮的领结，马吕斯。你很爱俏，大人，不，我不会厌烦。”</P>

    “我肯定你会厌烦的。”</P>

    “不会，因为是你们，我听不懂你们谈的话，但我能听着你们说话，听见心爱的人的声音，就不用去了解说的是什么了。只要能在一起，这就是我的要求。无论如何，我要和你们待在这儿。”</P>

    “你是我亲爱的珂赛特！但这件事不行。”</P>

    “不行！”</P>

    “对。”</P>

    “好吧，”珂赛特又说，“我本来有新闻要告诉你们。我本想告诉你们外祖父还在睡觉，姨妈上教堂去了，我父亲割风房间里的烟囱冒着烟，还有妮珂莱特找来了通烟囱的人，还有杜桑和妮珂莱特已吵了一架，妮珂莱特讥笑杜桑是结巴。好吧，你们什么也不知道。啊！这不行？我也一样，轮到我了，你看吧，先生，我也说：‘不行。’看看哪一个上了当？我求求你，我亲爱的马吕斯，让我和你俩在一起吧！”</P>

    “我向你发誓，我们必须单独谈话。”</P>

    “那么请

 Part 5 Book 7 Chapter 2 The Obscurities Which a Revelation Can Contain

    Marius was quite upset.</P>

    The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside whom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to him. There was something enigmatic about that person, of which his instinct had warned him.</P>

    This enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. This M. Fauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean. </P>

    To abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one's happiness resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves. </P>

    Was the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned to such a neighborhood? Was this an accomplished fact? Did the acceptance of that man form a part of the marriage now consummated? Was there nothing to be done?</P>

    Had Marius wedded the convict as well?</P>

    In vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may one taste the grand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force even the archangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, to shudder.</P>

    As is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. Had he been wanting in divination? Had he been wanting in prudence? Had he involuntarily dulled his wits? A little, perhaps. Had he entered upon this love affair, which had ended in his marriage to Cosette, without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings? He admitted,--it is thus, by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves, that life amends us, little by little,--he admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a sort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations, and which, in paroxysms of passion and sorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes, and invades the entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a conscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once indicated this characteristic element of Marius' individuality.</P>

    He recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet, during those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoke to Cosette of that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight. How had it happened that he had not mentioned this to Cosette? Yet it was so near and so terrible! How had it come to pass that he had not even named the Thenardiers, and, particularly, on the day when he had encountered Eponine? He now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time. Nevertheless, he could account for it. He recalled his benumbed state, his intoxication with Cosette, love absorbing everything, that catching away of each other into the ideal, and perhaps also, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure, contact with which he dreaded, in which he did not wish to play ny part, his agency in which he had kept secret, and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser. </P>

    Moreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had been no time for anything except love. </P>

    In short, having weighed everything, turned everything over in his mind, examined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if he had told Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered that Jean Valjean was a convict, would that have changed him, Marius? Would that have changed her, Cosette? Would he have drawn back? Would he have adored her any the less? Would he have refrained from marrying her? No. Then there was nothing to regret, nothing with which he need reproach himself. All was well. There is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers. Marius blind, had followed the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight. Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither? To paradise. </P>

    But this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal accompaniment.</P>

    Marius' ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this Fauchelevent who had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present mingled with horror. </P>

    In this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even a certain surprise.</P>

    This thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored that deposit. And what a deposit! Six hundred thousand francs. </P>

    He alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept it all, he had restored it all. </P>

    Moreover, he had himself revealed his situation. Nothing forced him to this. If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. In this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, there was acceptance of peril. For a condemned man, a mask is not a mask, it is a shelter. A false name is security, and he had rejected that false name. He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself forever in an honest family; he had withstood this temptation. And with what motive? Through a conscientious scruple. He himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth. In short, whatever this Jean Valjean might be, he was, undoubtedly, a conscience which was awakening. There existed some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun; and, to all appearances, scruples had for a long time already controlled this man. Such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures. An awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul.</P>

    Jean Valjean was sincere. This sincerity, visible, palpable, irrefragable, evident from the very grief that it caused him, rendered inquiries useless, and conferred authority on all that that man had said. </P>

    Here, for Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. What breathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust. What did Jean Valjean inspire? Confidence.</P>

    In the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive Marius struck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted the passive principle, and he tried to reach a balance. </P>

    But all this went on as in a storm. Marius, while endeavoring to form a clear idea of this man, and while pursuing Jean Valjean, so to speak, in the depths of his thought, lost him and found him again in a fatal mist.</P>

    The deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession-- these were good. This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud became black once more.</P>

    Troubled as were Marius' memories, a shadow of them returned to him.</P>

    After all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? Why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a complaint?</P>

    Here Marius found the answer. Because that man was a fugitive from justice, who had broken his ban. </P>

    Another question: Why had that man come to the barricade?</P>

    For Marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had re-appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of heat. This man had been in the barricade. He had not fought there. What had he come there for? In the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied: "Javert."</P>

    Marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of Jean Valjean dragging the pinioned Javert out of the barricade, and he still heard behind the corner of the little Rue Mondetour that frightful pistol shot. Obviously, there was hatred between that police spy and the galley-slave.The one was in the other's way. Jean Valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself. He had arrived late. He probably knew that Javert was a prisoner there.The Corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there; it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned towards good; and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal, who is in the path of repentance, may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance. Jean Valjean had killed Javert. At least, that seemed to be evident.</P>

    This was the final question, to be sure; but to this there was no reply. This question Marius felt like pincers. How had it come to pass that Jean Valjean's existence had elbowed that of Cosette for so long a period?</P>

    What melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed that child in contact with that man? Are there then chains for two which are forged on high? And does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon? So a crime and an innocence can be room-mates in the mysterious galleys of wretchedness? In that defiling of condemned persons which is called human destiny, can two brows pass side by side, the one ingenuous, the other formidable, the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn, the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning? Who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing off? In what manner, in consequence of what prodigy, had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal? </P>

    Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still more incomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf loved the lamb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble one, for, during the space of nine years, the angel had had the monster as her point of support. Cosette's childhood and girlhood, her advent in the daylight, her virginal growth towards life and light, had been sheltered by that hideous devotion. Here questions exfoliated, so to speak, into innumerable enigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses, and Marius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without becoming dizzy. What was this man-precipice?</P>

    The old symbols of Genesis are eternal; in human society, such as it now exists, and until a broader day shall effect a change in it, there will always be two men, the one superior, the other subterranean; the one which is according to good is Abel; the other which is according to evil is Cain. What was this tender Cain? What was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her, rearing her, guarding her, dignifying her, and enveloping her, impure as he was himself, with purity?</P>

    What was that cess-pool which had venerated that innocence to such a point as not to leave upon it a single spot? What was this Jean Valjean educating Cosette? What was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud?</P>

    That was Jean Valjean's secret; that was also God's secret.</P>

    In the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled. The one, in some sort, reassured him as to the other. God was as visible in this affair as was Jean Valjean. God has his instruments. He makes use of the tool which he wills. He is not responsible to men. Do we know how God sets about the work? Jean Valjean had labored over Cosette. He had, to some extent, made that soul. That was incontestable. Well, what then? The workman was horrible; but the work was admirable. God produces his miracles as seems good to him. He had constructed that charming Cosette, and he had employed Jean Valjean. It had pleased him to choose this strange collaborator for himself. What account have we to demand of him? Is this the first time that the dung-heap has aided the spring to create the rose?</P>

    Marius made himself these replies, and declared to himself that they were good. He had not dared to press Jean Valjean on all the points which we have just indicated, but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it. He adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette, Cosette was splendidly pure. That was sufficient for him. What enlightenment did he need? Cosette was a light. Does light require enlightenment? He had everything; what more could he desire? All,-- Xis not that enough? Jean Valjean's personal affairs did not concern him. </P>

    And bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast, convulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: "I am nothing to Cosette. Ten years ago I did not know that she was in existence."</P>

    Jean Valjean was a passer-by. He had said so himself. Well, he had passed. Whatever he was, his part was finished. </P>

    Henceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence to Cosette. Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, in her lover, her husband, her celestial male. Cosette, as she took her flight, winged and transfigured, left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis, Jean Valjean.</P>

    In whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned to a certain horror for Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as we have just pointed out, he felt a quid divinum in that man. But do what he would, and seek what extenuation he would, he was certainly forced to fall back upon this: the man was a convict; that is to say, a being who has not even a place in the social ladder, since he is lower than the very lowest rung. After the very last of men comes the convict. The convict is no longer, so to speak, in the semblance of the living. The law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man.</P>

    Marius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, though he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subject of those whom the law strikes. He had not yet accomplished all progress, we admit. He had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by God, between law and right. He had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not shocked by the word vindicte. He found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering, and he accepted, as the process of Xivilization, social damnation. He still stood at this point, though safe to advance infallibly later on, since his nature was good, and, at bottom, wholly formed of latent progress. </P>

    In this stage of his ideas, Jean Valjean appeared to him hideous and repulsive. He was a man reproved, he was the convict. That word was for him like the sound of the trump on the Day of Judgment; and, after having reflected upon Jean Valjean for a long time, his final gesture had been to turn away his head. Vade retro.</P>

    Marius, if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact, while interrogating Jean Valjean to such a point that Jean Valjean had said: "You are confessing me," had not, nevertheless, put to him two or three decisive questions.</P>

    It was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind, but that he had been afraid of them. The Jondrette attic? The barricade? Javert? Who knows where these revelations would have stopped? Jean Valjean did not seem like a man who would draw back, and who knows whether Marius, after having urged him on, would not have himself desired to hold him back?</P>

    Has it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have asked a question? It is especially when one loves that one gives way to these exhibitions of cowardice. It is not wise to question sinister situations to the last point, particularly when the indissoluble side of our life is fatally intermingled with them. What a terrible light might have proceeded from the despairing explanations of Jean Valjean, and who knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as Cosette? Who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel? The spattering of a lightning-flash is of the thunder also. Fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color. The purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible association. Rightly or wrongly, Marius had been afraid. He already knew too much. He sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light. </P>

    In dismay he bore off Cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to Jean Valjean.</P>

    That man was the night, the living and horrible night. How should he dare to seek the bottom of it? It is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow. Who knows what its reply will be? The dawn may be blackened forever by it.</P>

    In this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, come into any contact whatever with Cosette was a heartrending perplexity to Marius.</P>

    He now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable questions, before which he had recoiled, and from which an implacable and definitive decision might have sprung.He felt that he was too good, too gentle, too weak, if we must say the word.This weakness had led him to an imprudent concession. He had allowed himself to be touched. He had been in the wrong. He ought to have simply and purely rejected Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean played the part of fire, and that is what he should have done, and have freed his house from that man.</P>

    He was vexed with himself, he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions which had deafened, blinded, and carried him away. He was displeased with himself.</P>

    What was he to do now? Jean Valjean's visits were profoundly repugnant to him. What was the use in having that man in his house? What did the man want? Here, he became dismayed, he did not wish to dig down, he did not wish to penetrate deeply; he did not wish to sound himself. He had promised, he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise; Jean Valjean held his promise; one must keep one's word even to a convict, above all to a convict. Still, his first duty was to Cosette. In short, he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him. </P>

    Marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind, passing from one to the other, and moved by all of them. Hence arose a profound trouble.</P>

    It was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette, but love is a talent, and Marius succeeded in doing it. </P>

    However, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing; he talked of her childhood and her youth, and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good, paternal and respectable that a man can be towards Cosette. All that Marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real. That sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily.</P>

    马吕斯的心里乱极了。</P>

    对珂赛特身旁的这人他为什么一直都有着反感，从此就得到了解释，他的本能使他察觉到这人有着一种不知怎样的谜，这个谜，就是最丑的耻辱棗苦役。割风先生就是苦役犯冉阿让。</P>

    在他的幸福中突然发现这样一个秘密，正如在斑鸠巢中发现了一只蝎子。</P>

    马吕斯和珂赛特的幸福是否从此就得和这人有关？这是否是一个既成的事实？接纳这个人是已缔结婚姻的一个部分？</P>

    是否已毫无办法了？</P>

    难道马吕斯也娶了这个苦役犯？</P>

    尽管头上戴着光明和欢乐的冠冕，尽管在享受一生中黄金时刻的美满爱情，遇到这种打击，即使是欢欣得出神的天使，或是在荣光中神化的人也会被迫战栗起来。</P>

    马吕斯扪心自问，是否应归咎自己？这是一个人在这种突然的彻底改变时经常产生的现象。他是否缺少预见？是否太不谨慎？是否无意中鲁莽从事？可能有一点。他是否不够小心，没有把四周的情况了解清楚，就一头钻进这个以和珂赛特结婚告终的爱情故事里？他察觉到，经过一系列的自我观察，生活就是如此一点一点地把我们矫正过来；他察觉到，他的性情具有妄想和梦幻的一面，内在的烟雾是很多体质的特征，当恋爱和痛苦达到极端时，它就扩大了，心灵的温度变了，烟雾就侵占全身，使他只能有一个混沌的意识。我们不止一次地指出过马吕斯个性中这样一种独特的成分。他回想起在卜吕梅街当他陶醉在恋爱中时，在那心醉神迷的六七个星期里，他竟没有向珂赛特提起过戈尔博破屋中那谜一样的悲剧，其中的受害人在斗争里古怪地坚持缄默，后来又潜逃了。他怎么一点也没有向珂赛特谈到？而这是不久前发生的，又是这样骇人！怎么他连德纳第的名字也没有向她提过，尤其是当他遇到爱潘妮的那一天？现在他几乎无法理解他当时的沉默。其实他是意识到的。他想起当时他昏头昏脑，他为珂赛特而感到陶醉，爱情淹没了一切，彼此都陶醉在理想的境界中，也可能有那么一点不易察觉的理智混入了这强烈而又迷人的心境中，有一个模糊的隐隐约约的本能，想隐瞒消除记忆中他害怕接触的这一可怕的遭遇，他不愿在里面担任任何角色，他逃避这件事，他不能既当这件事的叙述者或证明人而同时又不成为揭发人。何况这几个星期一闪就过去了；除了相亲相爱之外，无暇他顾。最后他把一切衡量了一下，在反复检查思考之后，他认为即使他把戈尔博的埋伏绑架案告诉珂赛特，向她提出了德纳第的名字，其后果又该如何呢？即使他发现了冉阿让是一个苦役犯，这样能使自己发生变化吗？会使珂赛特发生变化吗？他是否会退缩？他是否会对珂赛特爱得少一点？他是否会不娶她？不会。这些对已经做了的事会有一点改变吗？不会。因此没有什么可后悔的，没有什么可自责的。一切都很好。这些被称作情人的陶醉者有一个上帝护卫着他们。盲目的马吕斯遵循了一条他清醒时也会选择的路。爱情蒙住了他的眼睛，把他带到什么地方去了呢？带进了天堂。</P>

    但这个天堂由于有地狱相随，从此变得复杂了。</P>

    过去马吕斯对这个人，这个变成冉阿让的割风的反感现在则又夹杂了厌恶。</P>

    在这厌恶中，我们可以说，也有点同情，甚至还有一定的惊奇的成分。</P>

    这个盗贼，这个惯犯，归还了一笔款子。一笔什么样的款子？六十万法郎。他是惟一知道这笔钱的秘密的人。他本可全部留下，但他却全部归还了。</P>

    此外，他自动暴露了他的身分。没有什么来迫使他暴露。如果有人知道他的底细，那也是由于他自己。他承认了，不仅要忍受耻辱，还要准备灾难临头。对判了刑的人来说，一个假面具不是假面具，而是一个避难所。他拒绝了这个避难所。一个假姓名意味着安全，但他抛弃了这个假姓名。他这个苦役犯尽可永远藏身在一个清白的人家；但他拒绝了这种诱惑。出自什么动机？出自良心的不安。他自己已用无法抑制的真实语气阐述了。总之，不论这冉阿让是个什么样的人，他肯定是个对良心悔悟的人。他心里开始有一种不知什么样的神秘的要重新做人的要求；而且，根据一切现象来看，在很久以前良心上的不安就已支配着这个人。这样极端公正和善良的心是不属于庸俗的人的。良心的觉醒就是灵魂的伟大。</P>

    冉阿让是诚实的。这种诚实看得见，摸得到，无可怀疑，单凭他付出的痛苦代价就足以证明，因而一切查问都已没有必要，可以绝对相信这个人所说的一切。这时，对马吕斯来说，位置是古怪地颠倒过来了。割风先生使人产生什么感觉？怀疑。</P>

    而从冉阿让那里得出的是什么？信任。</P>

    马吕斯经过苦思冥想，对冉阿让作了一份总结，查清了他的功和过，他设法想得到平衡。但这一切就象在一场风暴里一样。马吕斯力图对这个人得出一个明确的看法，可以说他一直追逐到冉阿让的思想深处，失去了线索，接着又在烟雾迷漫的厄运中重新找到了。</P>

    款子诚实地归还了，直言不讳地认罪，这些都是好现象。</P>

    这好象乌云里片刻的晴朗，接着乌云又变成漆黑的了。</P>

    马吕斯的回忆虽然十分混乱，但仍留下了一些模糊的印象。</P>

    容德雷特破屋中的那次遭遇究竟是怎么回事？为什么警察一到，这个人非但不告状，反而逃走了？马吕斯在这里找到了回答，原来这个人是个在逃的惯犯。</P>

    另一个问题：这个人为什么要到街垒里来？因为马吕斯已清楚地回想起了过去的这件事，现在在他情绪激动时，这事就象密写墨水靠近火一样，又重新显露出来了。这人曾经到街垒里来，但他并没有参加斗争。他来干什么？在这个问题上，一个鬼怪出来作了回答：沙威。马吕斯完全记得当时冉阿让那愁苦的幻影把捆着的沙威拖出了街垒。蒙德都巷子拐角后面可怕的手枪声还在他耳边回响。很可能这奸细和这犯人之间有仇恨。一个妨碍了另一个。冉阿让是到街垒里去复仇的。他来得较迟。大概他知道沙威被囚。科西嘉岛式的复仇①深入到了社会的底层，成为他们的法律；这种复仇平凡得使那些心已一半向善的人也不会感到惊异；他们的心就是这样：一个已走上忏悔之路的罪人，对于盗窃，良心会有所不安，面对复仇则是无所谓的。冉阿让杀死了沙威。至少这件事显然如此。 </P>

    ①科西嘉岛（Corse），法国在地中海里的岛屿，当地的复仇一直连累到敌对一方的家属。</P>

    最后还有一个问题，但这个问题无法作答。马吕斯感到这个问题象把钳子。冉阿让怎么会这样长时期地和珂赛特生活在一起？上天开的是种什么样的可悲的玩笑，要让这个孩子接触到这么一个人？难道上界也铸有双人链，上帝喜欢把天使和魔鬼拴在一起？难道一个罪人和一个纯洁的孩子在神秘的苦难监狱中可以同房作伴？在这被称作人类命运的判刑人的行列里，两个人的额头可以挨得如此近，一个是天真的，另一个是可怕的，一个沐浴着晨曦的神圣白光，另一个永远被一道永恒的闪电照得惨无人色？谁对这莫名其妙的搭配作出了决定？以什么方式？是一种什么样的奇迹使这个圣洁的孩子和老罪犯共同生活在一起？谁把羔羊和豺狼拴在一起？还更使人莫名其妙的是，去把狼拴在羔羊身上？因为狼爱羔羊，因为这野蛮人崇拜这脆弱的人，因为，九年以来，天使依靠恶魔作为支柱。珂赛特的幼年和青春，她的出生，这童贞少女向着生命和光明发育成长，都依靠这丑恶汉子的忠忱护卫。在这一点上，问题一层层解开了，可以说出现了无数的谜，深渊底下又出现深渊，致使马吕斯在俯视冉阿让时不能不晕头转向。这个断崖绝壁似的人究竟是怎么回事呢？</P>

    《创世记》里的老信条是永恒的，在一直存在着的人类社会中，直到将来的某一天，一种更大的光明来改变这个社会时，也永远会有两种人，一种是高尚的，另一种是卑下的；向善的是亚伯，作恶的是该隐。那么这个秉性善良的该隐又是什么呢？这个虔诚地一心一意崇拜一个圣女的盗贼，他守卫她，教养她，保护她，使她品格高尚，虽然他本身污秽。这个盗贼是个什么样的人呢？他是垃圾却尊敬一个天真的人，他把她培养得洁白无瑕，这又怎么理解呢？这个教育珂赛特的冉阿让是个什么人？这个黑暗的面孔唯一的目的就是防止阴影和云雾遮蔽一个星辰的升起，这又作何解释呢？</P>

    这是冉阿让的秘密，也是上帝的秘密。</P>

    在这双重秘密前面，马吕斯在后退。一个秘密可以说已使他对另一个秘密安了心。显而易见上帝和冉阿让一样参预了这一奇遇，上帝有自己的工具，他使用他愿意使用的工具。他对人类负责。我们知道上帝的办法吗？冉阿让在珂赛特身上付出了劳动。他也多少培养了这个灵魂。这是不容置疑的。那又怎么样呢？工匠令人感到恐怖；但作品是杰出的。上帝随心所欲地在显示他的奇迹。他创造出这个可爱的珂赛特，他为此而用上了冉阿让。他乐意挑选这个怪诞的助手。我们有什么可责难他的？难道厩肥是第一次帮助玫瑰花在春天开放吗？</P>

    马吕斯自问自答，认为自己这些答案是正确的。在我们所指出的一切论点上，他没敢深挖冉阿让，但又不敢向自己承认他不敢，他深深地爱着珂赛特，珂赛特已经属于他，珂赛特是出奇的纯洁。对此他心满意足。还需要搞清什么呢？珂赛特就是光明。光明还需要再明朗化吗？他已有了一切；还有什么其他的希求呢？应有尽有了，还不满足吗？冉阿让个人的事与他无关。当他对这个人的不幸阴影俯视时，他就紧紧抓住这悲惨的人庄严的声明：“我与珂赛特毫无关系，十年前，我还不知道她的存在呢！”</P>

    冉阿让是个过路人。他自己已说过。是啊，他是路过。不管他是什么人，他的任务已经完成。从今以后有马吕斯当珂赛特的靠山。珂赛特在灿烂的蓝天里找到了她的同类，她的情人，她的丈夫，她的卓绝的男人，珂赛特长出双翼神化了，在飞上天时她把她那丑恶的空蛹冉阿让扔在她后面的地下。</P>

    无论马吕斯在什么样的思想里打转，归根结底，他对冉阿让总有一定程度的厌恶。可能是种崇敬的厌恶，因为他感到这个人“有神圣的一面”①。无论他怎么处理，无论找什么减罪的情节，最后仍不得不回到这一点：这是一个苦役犯。这就是说在社会的阶梯上，一个连位子都没有的人，因为他处在楼梯的最后一级之下。最末一个人之后才是苦役犯。苦役犯可以说已经不是活着的人的同类。法律在他身上已剥夺了对一个人所能剥夺的全部人格。马吕斯虽然是共和派，但对刑罚却仍赞成严酷的制度，他对待被法律打击的人，看法和法律所判的完全一致。可以说他还没有接受一切进步的思想。他还不能辨别什么是人决定的，什么是上帝决定的，还不能区分法律和权利。人们自封有权处理不能挽回和不能补救的事，马吕斯一点也没研究估量过这种自封的权利。他觉得对成文法的某些破坏要受永久的处罚，这是很容易理解的，他同意社会把有些人罚入地狱是一种文明的做法。他还停留在这一步，当然以听也必然会前进，因为他的天性是善良的，实质上里面含有潜在的进步。</P>

    在这种思想范畴里，他觉得冉阿让畸形、讨厌。这是一个恶人，一个苦役犯。这个字眼对他来说就象末日审判时的号角；于是在长时间观察了冉阿让之后，他最后的态度是转过头去，“魔鬼退下”②。 </P>

    ①“有神圣的一面”，原文为拉丁文，quid　divinum。</P>

    ②“魔鬼退下”，原文为拉丁文Vade　retro。　</P>

    我们应当承认并且还该着重指出马吕斯对冉阿让曾经提过问题，而冉阿让向他说：“你在让我招供。”其实他还并没有提出两三个决定性的问题。并非他想不起这些问题，而是他怕这些问题。容德雷特破屋？街垒？沙威？谁知道揭到什么时候才会有完？冉阿让不象是个畏缩的人。谁知道，如果马吕斯追问后，他是否会希望冉阿让不再说下去？在某些重要关头，我们大家难道不曾遇到过，在提了一个问题之后，自己去塞住耳朵不想听到答复？尤其是在恋爱时期是会有这种懦弱的现象的。过分追究险恶的情况是不谨慎的，尤其当我们自己生活里不能割断的一面又不幸牵涉在里面时。冉阿让失望的解释，可能会暴露出一些可怕的事，谁知道这道丑恶的光是否会波及珂赛特？谁知道在珂赛特天使般的额头上是否已留下这种地狱之光呢？溅出的闪电的光仍属霹雳。天数里有着这种相互的关连，由于阴沉的染色反光律在起作用，无辜的人也会染上罪恶的痕迹，最清白的面容也可以永远保留着可憎的近邻的反射。无论正确与否，马吕斯害怕了。他已知道得太多了。他想含糊过去，并不打算弄清底细。他在失望时昏乱地抱走珂赛特，闭目不看冉阿让。</P>

    这个人属于黑暗，属于活生生的可怖的黑夜。他怎么敢追根问底呢？盘问黑影是种恐怖。谁知道它将如何作答。黎明可能会永远被它玷污！</P>

    在这种思想状态里，一想到这个人今后将和珂赛特会有某种接触时马吕斯感到惊惶失措。这些可怕的问题，当时他是退缩不敢提，这些问题本可能会使他得出一个毫不容情的一刀两断的决定，他此刻几乎埋怨自己没有把它提出来。他觉得自己心肠太好，太宽厚，也就是说，太懦弱了。这种软弱使他作出了一个不谨慎的让步。他被人感动了。他不该如此。他应该简单而干脆地甩开冉阿让。冉阿让是惹祸的人，他应该牺牲他，把他从家中赶出去。他责怪自己，他怪自己突然被激动搞糊涂了，使自己耳聋眼瞎，被拖着跑了。他对自己感到很不满。</P>

    现在怎么办呢？冉阿让的来访使他十分反感。这个人到他家？来有什么用？怎么办？至此他已头昏眼花，他不愿深思，不愿细察，也不愿追问自己。他已经答应了，他被动地答应了；冉阿让得到了他的诺言；即使对一个苦役犯，尤其对一个苦役犯，也决不能食言，然而他首先要负起的责任仍是珂赛特。总之，一种压倒一切的厌恶在支配他。</P>

    所有这些想法在马吕斯脑海中混乱地上下翻腾，从一种想法转到另一种，每一种都使他激动，他因而极端惶惑。要在珂赛特面前隐藏起这种情绪是不容易的，但爱情是天才，马吕斯做到了。</P>

    此外，他似乎无目的地向珂赛特提了几个问题，天真无邪，洁白如鸽子的珂赛特毫不怀疑；他向她谈到她的幼年和少年时期，于是他越来越深信凡是一个人能具有的善良、慈爱和可敬之处，对珂赛特来说这个苦役犯都是具有的。马吕斯的预感和推测都是正确的。这株可怕的荨麻疼爱并且护卫了这朵百合花。</P>

 Part 5 Book 8 Chapter 1 The Lower Chamber

    On the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at the carriage gate of the Gillenormand house. It was Basque who received him. Basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour, as though he had received his orders. It sometimes happens that one says to a servant: "You will watch for Mr. So and so, when he arrives."</P>

    Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him:</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below?"</P>

    "I will remain below," replied Jean Valjean.</P>

    Basque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of the waiting-room and said:</P>

    "I will go and inform Madame."</P>

    The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on the ground floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on the street, was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window. </P>

    This chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the feather-duster, the pope's head brush, and the broom. The dust rested tranquilly there. Persecution of the spiders was not organized there. A fine web, which spread far and wide, and was very black and ornamented with dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. The room, which was small and low-ceiled, was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner.</P>

    The wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was scaling off in large flakes. At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with a narrow shelf. A fire was burning there; which indicated that Jean Valjean's reply: "I will remain below," had been foreseen.</P>

    Two arm-chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. Between the chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation thread than wool, had been spread by way of a carpet. </P>

    The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window. </P>

    Jean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. He threw himself into one of the arm-chairs. </P>

    Basque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired. Jean Valjean, his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast, perceived neither Basque nor the candle.</P>

    All at once, he drew himself up with a start. Cosette was standing beside him.</P>

    He had not seen her enter, but he had felt that she was there.</P>

    He turned round. He gazed at her. She was adorably lovely. But what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul.</P>

    "Well," exclaimed Cosette, "father, I knew that you were peculiar, but I never should have expected this. What an idea! Marius told me that you wish me to receive you here."</P>

    "Yes, it is my wish."</P>

    "I expected that reply. Good. I warn you that I am going to make a scene for you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father." </P>

    And she offered him her cheek.</P>

    Jean Valjean remained motionless.</P>

    "You do not stir. I take note of it. Attitude of guilt. But never mind, I pardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the other cheek. Here it is."</P>

    And she presented her other cheek.</P>

    Jean Valjean did not move. It seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement.</P>

    "This is becoming serious," said Cosette. "What have I done to you? I declare that I am perplexed. You owe me reparation. You will dine with us."</P>

    "I have dined."</P>

    "That is not true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. Grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs with me to the drawing-room. Immediately."</P>

    "Impossible."</P>

    Here Cosette lost ground a little. She ceased to command and passed to questioning.</P>

    "But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me. It's horrible here."</P>

    "Thou knowest . . ."</P>

    Jean Valjean caught himself up.</P>

    "You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks."</P>

    Cosette struck her tiny hands together.</P>

    "Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties! What is the meaning of this?"</P>

    Jean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse:</P>

    "You wished to be Madame. You are so."</P>

    "Not for you, father."</P>

    "Do not call me father."</P>

    "What?"</P>

    "Call me `Monsieur Jean.' `Jean,' if you like." </P>

    "You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette?`Monsieur Jean'? What does this mean? Why, these are revolutions, aren't they? What has taken place? Come, look me in the face. And you won't live with us! And you won't have my chamber! What have I done to you? Has anything happened?" </P>

    "Nothing."</P>

    "Well then?"</P>

    "Everything is as usual."</P>

    "Why do you change your name?"</P>

    "You have changed yours, surely."</P>

    He smiled again with the same smile as before and added:</P>

    "Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur Jean."</P>

    "I don't understand anything about it. All this is idiotic. I shall ask permission of my husband for you to be `Monsieur Jean.' I hope that he will not consent to it. You cause me a great deal of pain. One does have freaks, but one does not cause one's little Cosette grief. That is wrong. You have no right to be wicked, you who are so good."</P>

    He made no reply.</P>

    She seized his hands with vivacity, and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement, she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin, which is a gesture of profound tenderness. </P>

    "Oh!" she said to him, "be good!"</P>

    And she went on:</P>

    "This is what I call being good: being nice and coming and living here,-- there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet,--living with us, quitting that hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme, not giving us riddles to guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us, breakfasting with us, being my father."</P>

    He loosed her hands.</P>

    "You no longer need a father, you have a husband."</P>

    Cosette became angry.</P>

    "I no longer need a father! One really does not know what to say to things like that, which are not common sense!" </P>

    "If Toussaint were here," resumed Jean Valjean, like a person who is driven to seek authorities, and who clutches at every branch, "she would be the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of my own. There is nothing new in this. I always have loved my black corner." </P>

    "But it is cold here. One cannot see distinctly. It is abominable, that it is, to wish to be Monsieur Jean! I will not have you say `you' to me.</P>

    "Just now, as I was coming hither," replied Jean Valjean, "I saw a piece of furniture in the Rue Saint Louis. It was at a cabinet-maker's. If I were a pretty woman, I would treat myself to that bit of furniture. A very neat toilet table in the reigning style. What you call rosewood, I think. It is inlaid. The mirror is quite large. There are drawers. It is pretty." </P>

    "Hou! The villainous bear!" replied Cosette.</P>

    And with supreme grace, setting her teeth and drawing back her lips, she blew at Jean Valjean. She was a Grace copying a cat. </P>

    "I am furious," she resumed. "Ever since yesterday, you have made me rage, all of you. I am greatly vexed. I don't understand. You do not defend me against Marius. Marius will not uphold me against you. I am all alone. I arrange a chamber prettily. If I could have put the good God there I would have done it. My chamber is left on my hands. My lodger sends me into bankruptcy. I order a nice little dinner of Nicolette. We will have nothing to do with your dinner, Madame. And my father Fauchelevent wants me to call him `Monsieur Jean,' and to receive him in a frightful, old, ugly cellar, where the walls have beards, and where the crystal consists of empty bottles, and the curtains are of spiders' webs! You are singular, I admit, that is your style, but people who get married are granted a truce. You ought not to have begun being singular again instantly. So you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable Rue de l'Homme Arme. I was very desperate indeed there, that I was. What have you against me? You cause me a great deal of grief. Fi!"</P>

    And, becoming suddenly serious, she gazed intently at Jean Valjean and added:</P>

    "Are you angry with me because I am happy?"</P>

    Ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep. This question, which was simple for Cosette, was profound for Jean Valjean. Cosette had meant to scratch, and she lacerated. </P>

    Jean Valjean turned pale.</P>

    He remained for a moment without replying, then, with an inexpressible intonation, and speaking to himself, he murmured:"Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign my dismissal. Cosette, thou art happy; my day is over." </P>

    "Ah, you have said thou to me!" exclaimed Cosette. </P>

    And she sprang to his neck. </P>

    Jean Valjean, in bewilderment, strained her wildly to his breast. It almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back. </P>

    "Thanks, father!" said Cosette. </P>

    This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for Jean Valjean. He gently removed Cosette's arms, and took his hat. </P>

    "Well?" said Cosette. </P>

    "I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you."</P>

    And, from the threshold, he added:</P>

    "I have said thou to you. Tell your husband that this shall not happen again. Pardon me." </P>

    Jean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at this enigmatical farewell.</P>

    第二天，黄昏时刻，冉阿让去敲吉诺曼家的大门。迎接他的是巴斯克。巴斯克恰好在院子里，好象他已接到命令。有时候我们会关照仆人：“你在这儿守着某某人，他就要来了。”</P>

    巴斯克未等冉阿让来到跟前就问他：</P>

    “男爵先生叫我问先生，要上楼还是待在楼下？”</P>

    “在楼下。”冉阿让回答。</P>

    巴斯克确是十分恭敬的，他把地下室的门打开了说，“我去通知夫人。”</P>

    冉阿让走进了一间有拱顶的潮湿的地下室，有时这是当作酒窖用的。昏暗的光线从一扇有铁栏杆的开向街心的红格玻璃窗里射进来。</P>

    这不是一间象其他被拂尘、打扫天花板的掸子以及扫帚经常清理过的房间，灰尘在里面安安静静地堆积着。对蜘蛛的消灭计划还没有建立。一个精致的黑黑的大蛛网张挂着，上面缀满死苍蝇，装腔作势地铺呈在一块窗玻璃上。房间既小又矮，墙角有着一堆空酒瓶。墙壁刷成赭黄色，石灰大片大片剥落。靠里有一个木质的壁炉漆成黑色，炉架窄小，炉中生了火，很明显，这说明他们估计冉阿让的回答是“在下面”。</P>

    两把扶手椅放在火炉两旁，在扶手椅之间铺了一块床前小垫，代替地毯，小垫只剩下粗绳，几乎没有羊毛了。</P>

    房间利用火炉的光和从窗子透进来的黄昏天色来照明。</P>

    冉阿让疲乏不堪。好几天来他不吃也不睡，他倒在一张扶手椅里。</P>

    巴斯克进来，把一支燃着的蜡烛放在炉架上又走了。冉阿让低着头，下巴垂在胸口上，没有看见巴斯克，也没看见蜡烛。</P>

    忽然他兴奋地站了起来，珂赛特已在他后面。</P>

    他没有见她进来，但他感到她进来了。</P>

    他转过身来，他打量她，她美丽得令人仰慕。但他用深邃的目光观望的不是美丽的容貌，而是灵魂。</P>

    “啊，不错，”珂赛特大声说，“好一种想法！父亲，我知道您有怪癖，但我再也想不到会有这一着。马吕斯告诉我您要我在这里接待您。”</P>

    “是的，是我。”</P>

    “我已猜到您的回答，好吧，我警告您，我要和您大闹一场。从头开始，父亲，先来吻我。”</P>

    她把面颊凑过去。</P>

    冉阿让呆呆地不动。</P>

    “您动也不动，我看清楚了，这是有罪的表现。算了，我原谅您。耶稣说：‘把另一边面颊转向他①。’在这里。” </P>

    ①耶稣曾说过有人打了你右边的面颊，你把左边的也送上去。</P>

    她把另一边脸凑过去。</P>

    冉阿让一动也不动，好象他的脚已被钉在地上了。</P>

    “这可严重了，”珂赛特说，“我怎么得罪您了？我声明要翻脸了，你得和我言归于好。您来和我们一起吃饭。”</P>

    “我吃过了。”</P>

    “不是真话，我找吉诺曼外祖父来责备您，祖父可以训父亲。快快和我一同上客厅去吧，立刻走。”</P>

    “不行。”</P>

    到此，珂赛特感到有点拿不住了，她不再命令而转为提问。</P>

    “为什么？您挑选家里最简陋的房间来看我，这里真待不住。”</P>

    “你知道……”</P>

    冉阿让又改口说：</P>

    “您知道，夫人，我很特别，我有我的怪癖。”</P>

    珂赛特拍着小手。</P>

    “夫人！……您知道！……又是件新鲜事！这是什么意思？”</P>

    冉阿让向她苦笑，有时他就这样笑着。</P>

    “您要当夫人，您是夫人了。”</P>

    “但对您可不是，父亲。”</P>

    “别再叫我父亲。”</P>

    “为什么？”</P>

    “叫我让先生，或者让，随您的便。”</P>

    “您不是父亲了？我也不是珂赛特了？让先生？这是什么意思？这是革命，这些！发生了什么事？请您看着我。您也不愿来和我们同住！您又不要我的房间！我怎么得罪了您？我怎么得罪您啦？难道发生了什么事？”</P>

    “没有。”</P>

    “那又为什么呢？”</P>

    “一切仍象过去一样。”</P>

    “您为什么要改变姓名？”</P>

    “您不是也改了，您。”</P>

    他仍带着那种微笑对着她并且还说：</P>

    “既然您是彭眉胥夫人，我也可以是让先生。”</P>

    “我一点也不明白，这一切都是愚蠢的。我要问我的丈夫是否允许我称您让先生，我希望他不同意。您使我多么难受，您有怪癖，但也不必使您的小珂赛特难过呀！这不好。您没有权利变得厉害，您原来是善良的！”</P>

    他不回答。</P>

    她很快地抓住他的双手，用无法抵抗的举动，把手靠近自己的脸，她又紧紧地把手挨着她的脖子，放在下巴下面，这是一种极温柔的动作。</P>

    “啊，”她向他说，“请您仁慈点吧！”</P>

    她又继续说：</P>

    “我说仁慈是指和气，来住在这里，恢复我们那有益的短时间的散步，这里和卜吕梅街一样也有小鸟，来和我们一起生活，离开武人街那个洞，别让我们来猜谜，和其他人一样，来和我们一起吃饭，和我们一起吃早餐，做我的父亲。”</P>

    他把手缩回去。</P>

    “您不需要父亲了，您已有了丈夫。”</P>

    珂赛特冒火了。</P>

    “我不需要父亲了！这种话太不近人情，真令人不知说什么好！”</P>

    “如果杜桑在的话，”冉阿让说时好象一个在找靠山、抓住任何树枝就不放的人，“她会第一个承认我真是有我自己的一套习惯。什么事也没有发生，我一直喜欢我的黑暗的角落。”</P>

    “这里冷得很，看也看不清。要当让先生，这真糟透了，我不要您对我用‘您’称呼。”</P>

    “刚才来的时候，”冉阿让回答，“在圣路易街乌木器店里我看见一件木器，如果我是个漂亮的妇女，我就要把这件木器买到手。一个很好的梳妆台，式样新，我想就是你们所说的香木，上面嵌了花，一面相当大的镜子，有抽屉，很好看。”</P>

    “哼！怪人！”珂赛特回答。</P>

    于是她用十分可爱的神气，咬紧牙咧开嘴向冉阿让吹气。</P>

    这是一个美神在学小猫的动作。</P>

    “我气愤得很，”她又说，“从昨天起你们全都在使我发怒，我心里很恼火，我不懂。您不帮我对付马吕斯，马吕斯不支持我对付您。我是孤单的。我布置得很好的一间卧室。如果我能把上帝请来，我也都想请进去。你们把房间甩给我。我的房客跑掉了。我叫妮珂莱特准备一顿美味的晚餐。‘人家不要吃您的晚餐，夫人。’还有我的父亲割风要我叫他让先生，还要我在这个可怕的陈旧简陋的发霉的地窖里接待他，这儿墙上长了胡子，空瓶代替水晶器皿，蛛网代替窗帘！您性情古怪，这我承认，这是您的个性，但对刚结婚的人总得暂时休战。您不该立刻就变得很古怪。您居然能在那可恨的武人街住得很安逸。在那里我本人倒是悲观失望的！您对我有什么不满？您使我十分难过。呸！”</P>

    然后，忽而又一本正经，她盯住冉阿让又说：</P>

    “您不高兴是因为我幸福了？”</P>

    天真的话，有时不自觉地点得十分透。这个问题，对珂赛特来说是简单的，对冉阿让则是严酷的。珂赛特要让他痛一下，结果使他心肝俱裂了。</P>

    冉阿让脸色惨白。他停了一下不回答，然后用一种无法形容的声音好象自言自语地轻轻说：</P>

    “她的幸福，是我生活的目的。现在上帝可以召唤我去了。</P>

    珂赛特，你幸福了，我没有用了。”</P>

    “啊！您对我称‘你’了！”珂赛特叫起来。</P>

    于是她跳过去抱住他的脖子。</P>

    象失去了理智那样冉阿让热烈地把她紧抱在胸前，他好象觉得他又把她找回来了。</P>

    “谢谢，父亲！”珂赛特说。</P>

    这种激动的感情正要使冉阿让变得非常伤心，他慢慢地离开珂赛特的手臂并且拿起他的帽子。</P>

    “怎么啦？”珂赛特说。</P>

    冉阿让回答：</P>

    “我走了，夫人，别人在等您。”</P>

    在到门口时，又加了一句：</P>

    “我对您称了‘你’，请告诉您的丈夫，以后我不再这样称呼您了，请原谅我。”</P>

    冉阿让出去了。留下珂赛特在为这莫名其妙的告别而发呆。</P>

 Part 5 Book 8 Chapter 2 Another Step Backwards

    On the following day, at the same hour, Jean Valjean came.</P>

    Cosette asked him no questions, was no longer astonished, no longer exclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke of the drawing-room, she avoided saying either "father" or "Monsieur Jean." She allowed herself to be addressed as you. She allowed herself to be called Madame. Only, her joy had undergone a certain diminution. She would have been sad, if sadness had been possible to her. </P>

    It is probable that she had had with Marius one of those conversations in which the beloved man says what he pleases, explains nothing, and satisfies the beloved woman. The curiosity of lovers does not extend very far beyond their own love.</P>

    The lower room had made a little toilet. Basque had suppressed the bottles, and Nicolette the spiders. </P>

    All the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour. He came every day, because he had not the strength to take Marius' words otherwise than literally. Marius arranged matters so as to be absent at the hours when Jean Valjean came. The house grew accustomed to the novel ways of M. Fauchelevent. Toussaint helped in this direction: "Monsieur has always been like that," she repeated. The grandfather issued this decree:--"He's an original." And all was said. Moreover, at the age of ninety-six, no bond is any longer possible, all is merely juxtaposition; a newcomer is in the way.There is no longer any room; all habits are acquired. M. Fauchelevent, M. Tranchelevent, Father Gillenormand asked nothing better than to be relieved from "that gentleman." He added:--"Nothing is more common than those originals. They do all sorts of queer things. They have no reason. The Marquis de Canaples was still worse. He bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret. These are fantastic appearances that people affect." </P>

    No one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation. And moreover, who could have guessed such a thing? There are marshes of this description in India. The water seems extraordinary, inexplicable, rippling though there is no wind, and agitated where it should be calm. One gazes at the surface of these causeless ebullitions; one does not perceive the hydra which crawls on the bottom.</P>

    Many men have a secret monster in this same manner, a dragon which gnaws them, a despair which inhabits their night. Such a man resembles other men, he goes and comes. No one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth, which lives within the unhappy man, and of which he is dying. No one knows that this man is a gulf. He is stagnant but deep. From time to time, a trouble of which the onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface. A mysterious wrinkle is formed, then vanishes, then re-appears; an air-bubble rises and bursts. It is the breathing of the unknown beast.</P>

    Certain strange habits: arriving at the hour when other people are taking their leave, keeping in the background when other people are displaying themselves, preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the wall-colored mantle, seeking the solitary walk, preferring the deserted street, avoiding any share in conversation, avoiding crowds and festivals, seeming at one's ease and living poorly, having one's key in one's pocket, and one's candle at the porter's lodge, however rich one may be, entering by the side door, ascending the private staircase,--all these insignificant singularities, fugitive folds on the surface, often proceed from a formidable foundation. </P>

    Many weeks passed in this manner. A new life gradually took possession of Cosette: the relations which marriage creates, visits, the care of the house, pleasures, great matters. Cosette's pleasures were not costly, they consisted in one thing: being with Marius. The great occupation of her life was to go out with him, to remain with him. It was for them a joy that was always fresh, to go out arm in arm, in the face of the sun, in the open street, without hiding themselves, before the whole world, both of them completely alone. </P>

    Cosette had one vexation. Toussaint could not get on with Nicolette, the soldering of two elderly maids being impossible, and she went away. The grandfather was well; Marius argued a case here and there; Aunt Gillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her, beside the new household. Jean Valjean came every day.</P>

    The address as thou disappeared, the you, the "Madame," the "Monsieur Jean," rendered him another person to Cosette. The care which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding. She became more and more gay and less and less tender. Yet she still loved him sincerely, and he felt it.</P>

    One day she said to him suddenly: "You used to be my father, you are no longer my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, you were Monsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don't like all this. If I did not know how good you are, I should be afraid of you."</P>

    He still lived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, because he could not make up his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt. </P>

    At first, he only remained a few minutes with Cosette, and then went away.</P>

    Little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief. One would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of the days which were lengthening, he arrived earlier and departed later. </P>

    One day Cosette chanced to say "father" to him. A flash of joy illuminated Jean Valjean's melancholy old countenance.He caught her up: "Say Jean."--"Ah! truly," she replied with a burst of laughter, "Monsieur Jean."--"That is right," said he. And he turned aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes.</P>

    第二天，在同一时刻冉阿让来了。</P>

    珂赛特不再问他，不再表示惊讶，不再叫她觉得冷，不再提客厅的事了；她避免称他父亲或让先生，她任他称“您”，任他称“夫人”，只是她的欢乐减弱了。如果她有可能愁闷的话，她会发愁的。</P>

    很可能她和马吕斯已作过一次这样的谈话，她的爱人在这次谈话里说了要说的话但不加任何解释，而且还使爱妻满意。相爱的人对爱情之外的事物好奇心是不会太大的。</P>

    地下室被稍稍整理了一下。巴斯克拿走了瓶子，妮珂莱特清除了蜘蛛网。</P>

    这之后，在这同一时刻冉阿让都来到。他每天来，他没有勇气不照马吕斯所说的来办。马吕斯则设法让自己在冉阿让来时不在家。家里人对割风先生这种新的情况也习惯了。杜桑也帮着解释。“先生一贯就是这样的。”她这样重复着。外祖父作了这样一个结论：“这是一个怪人。”一句话就道尽一切。此外九十岁的人不可能还有什么交往，一切都只是凑合而已，来一个新人不免使人感到拘束，已没有空位置了；一切习惯都已养成。割风先生，切风先生，吉诺曼外祖父觉得最好这位“先生”别来。他还说：“这种怪人是常见的。他们经常做些怪事。什么目的？没有。戈那勃勒侯爵比他更怪。他买了一座宫殿，自己却住在阁楼里。有些人是会有这种古怪的表现的！”</P>

    没有人能隐隐约约地感到隐藏着的可怕的东西。谁能去猜这样的事？印度有种沼泽，那里的水好象很特别，无法理解，无风时水生波纹；该平静处却会起浪。人们看到水面无故波涛起伏，但看不到水底有条七头蛇在爬行。</P>

    这样很多人都有一种秘密的怪物，一种自己养成的病痛；一条啃啮他们的龙，一种使他们在夜间不得安息的绝望。这种人和其他人一样，来来去去。我们不知道他有着一种痛苦，一种可怕的长着一千颗牙的生物寄生在这悲惨的人的身上，导致他的死亡。我们不知道这人是个深渊，他是死水，深极了。不知什么缘故水面偶尔出现混乱。一圈神秘的水纹，忽然不见了，忽然又出现；一个水泡升上来又破灭了。这是不足道的小事一件，但却很可怕。这是只人所不知的野兽在呼吸。</P>

    人有某些古怪的习惯，有人在别人离去时来到，在别人炫耀时隐藏，一切场合他都穿上一件我们称作土墙那种颜色的外衣，专找僻静的小路，喜欢无人走的街。不参加别人的谈话，避开人群和节日，貌似宽裕其实却很清寒，尽管很富，但还总是自己装着钥匙，烛台放在门房里，从小门进来，走隐秘的楼梯，所有这些无关紧要的奇特的举动，诸如涟漪、气泡、水面转瞬即逝的波纹，常常是来自一个可怕的深处。</P>

    几个星期就这样过去了。一种新的生活慢慢地支配了珂赛特；婚后有种种事务如拜客、家务、娱乐等这些大事。珂赛特的娱乐并不费钱，主要可以归纳为一项：和马吕斯在一起。和他一同出去，和他待在一起，这是她生活里的大事。他们随时手挽手一同上街，在阳光下，在大路上，不用躲避，就他们两人，出现在众人面前，对他们来说这永远是种新的欢乐。珂赛特有件不称心的事，就是杜桑因和妮珂莱特合不来而离去了。要使两个老处女处得好是不可能的。外祖父身体很好；马吕斯有时为几起诉讼出庭辩护；吉诺曼姨妈安静而知足地在新夫妇身旁过着她的次要地位的生活。冉阿让每日都来。用“你”的称呼不见了，用的是“您”、“夫人”和“让先生”，这样使他在珂赛特面前就不一样了。他设法使珂赛特和他疏远，这已有了成效。她越来越快乐，而温情却一天比一天少下去。其实她仍很爱他，这一点他也感觉得到。有一天她忽然向他说：“您曾是我的父亲，现在不是了，您曾是我的叔叔，现在不是了，您本是割风先生，而现在却成让先生了。您究竟是什么人呢？我不喜欢这些。如果我不知道您是这样的善良，那我见您就会害怕了。”</P>

    他仍住在武人街，下不了决心离开珂赛特居住的地区。</P>

    开始时他只和珂赛特在一起待上几分钟就走了。</P>

    慢慢地他养成了把探望时间延长一点的习惯，就象是由于白天长了，他也可以这样做一样，他来得早一点，离开得晚一点。</P>

    有一天珂赛特脱口叫了他一声“父亲”。冉阿让年老阴沉的脸上闪过一道快乐的光，他关照她：“叫让。”“啊，对了，”她一边大笑一边答话，“让先生。”“很好，”他说。他转过身去不让她看见他在擦他的眼睛。</P>

 Part 5 Book 8 Chapter 3 They Recall the Garden of the Rue Plumet

    This was the last time. After that last flash of light, complete extinction ensued. No more familiarity, no more good-morning with a kiss, never more that word so profoundly sweet: "My father!" He was at his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happinesses one after the other; and he had this sorrow, that after having lost Cosette wholly in one day, he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail. </P>

    The eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. In short, it sufficed for him to have an apparition of Cosette every day. His whole life was concentrated in that one hour. </P>

    He seated himself close to her, he gazed at her in silence, or he talked to her of years gone by, of her childhood, of the convent, of her little friends of those bygone days. </P>

    One afternoon,--it was on one of those early days in April, already warm and fresh, the moment of the sun's great gayety, the gardens which surrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking, the hawthorn was on the point of budding, a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance, the wind, that minstrel of the eternal wedding, was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand, auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide,--Marius said to Cosette:--"We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the Rue Plumet.Let us go thither.We must not be ungrateful."--And away they flitted, like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of the Rue Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn. They already had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their love. The house in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease, still belonged to Cosette. They went to that garden and that house. There they found themselves again, there they forgot themselves. That evening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean came to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.--"Madame went out with Monsieur and has not yet returned," Basque said to him. He seated himself in silence, and waited an hour. Cosette did not return. He departed with drooping head.</P>

    Cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to "their garden," and so joyous at having "lived a whole day in her past," that she talked of nothing else on the morrow. She did not notice that she had not seen Jean Valjean.</P>

    "In what way did you go thither?" Jean Valjean asked her."</P>

    "On foot."</P>

    "And how did you return?"</P>

    "In a hackney carriage."</P>

    For some time, Jean Valjean had noticed the economical life led by the young people. He was troubled by it. Marius' economy was severe, and that word had its absolute meaning for Jean Valjean. He hazarded a query:</P>

    "Why do you not have a carriage of your own? A pretty coupe would only cost you five hundred francs a month. You are rich."</P>

    "I don't know," replied Cosette.</P>

    "It is like Toussaint," resumed Jean Valjean. "She is gone. You have not replaced her. Why?" </P>

    "Nicolette suffices."</P>

    "But you ought to have a maid."</P>

    "Have I not Marius?"</P>

    "You ought to have a house of your own, your own servants, a carriage, a box at the theatre. There is nothing too fine for you. Why not profit by your riches? Wealth adds to happiness." </P>

    Cosette made no reply.</P>

    Jean Valjean's visits were not abridged. Far from it. When it is the heart which is slipping, one does not halt on the downward slope. </P>

    When Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour, he sang the praises of Marius; he pronounced him handsome, noble, courageous, witty, eloquent, good. Cosette outdid him. Jean Valjean began again. They were never weary. Marius--that word was inexhaustible; those six letters contained volumes. In this manner, Jean Valjean contrived to remain a long time. </P>

    It was so sweet to see Cosette, to forget by her side! It alleviated his wounds. It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce: "M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is served."</P>

    On those days, Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home.</P>

    Was there, then, any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of Marius? Was Jean Valjean really a chrysalis who would persist, and who would come to visit his butterfly?</P>

    One day he remained still longer than usual. On the following day he observed that there was no fire on the hearth.--"Hello!" he thought. "No fire."--And he furnished the explanation for himself.--"It is perfectly simple. It is April. The cold weather has ceased."</P>

    "Heavens! How cold it is here!" exclaimed Cosette when she entered.</P>

    "Why, no," said Jean Valjean.</P>

    "Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then?"</P>

    "Yes, since we are now in the month of May."</P>

    "But we have a fire until June. One is needed all the year in this cellar."</P>

    "I thought that a fire was unnecessary."</P>

    "That is exactly like one of your ideas!" retorted Cosette.</P>

    On the following day there was a fire. But the two arm-chairs were arranged at the other end of the room near the door. "--What is the meaning of this?" thought Jean Valjean.</P>

    He went for the arm-chairs and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth.</P>

    This fire lighted once more encouraged him, however. He prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits. As he rose to take his leave, Cosette said to him:</P>

    "My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday."</P>

    "What was it?"</P>

    "He said to me: `Cosette, we have an income of thirty thousand livres. Twenty-seven that you own, and three that my grandfather gives me.' I replied: That makes thirty.' He went on: Would you have the courage to live on the three thousand?' I answered:` Yes, on nothing. Provided that it was with you.' And then I asked: Why do you say that to me?' He replied: I wanted to know.'"</P>

    Jean Valjean found not a word to answer. Cosette probably expected some explanation from him; he listened in gloomy silence. He went back to the Rue de l'Homme Arme; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house, he entered the adjoining dwelling. It was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again. </P>

    His mind was swarming with conjectures. It was evident that Marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs, that he feared some source that was not pure, who knows? That he had even, perhaps, discovered that the money came from him, Jean Valjean, that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune, and was disinclined to take it as his own,--preferring that both he and Cosette should remain poor, rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean.</P>

    Moreover, Jean Valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door.</P>

    On the following day, he underwent something like a shock on entering the ground-floor room. The arm-chairs had disappeared. There was not a single chair of any sort.</P>

    "Ah, what's this!" exclaimed Cosette as she entered,"no chairs! Where are the arm-chairs?"</P>

    "They are no longer here," replied Jean Valjean. </P>

    "This is too much!"</P>

    Jean Valjean stammered:</P>

    "It was I who told Basque to remove them."</P>

    "And your reason?"</P>

    "I have only a few minutes to stay to-day."</P>

    "A brief stay is no reason for remaining standing."</P>

    "I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room.</P>

    "Why?"</P>

    "You have company this evening, no doubt."</P>

    "We expect no one."</P>

    Jean Valjean had not another word to say.</P>

    Cosette shrugged her shoulders.</P>

    "To have the chairs carried off! The other day you had the fire put out. How odd you are!" </P>

    "Adieu!" murmured Jean Valjean.</P>

    He did not say: "Adieu, Cosette." But he had not the strength to say: "Adieu, Madame." </P>

    He went away utterly overwhelmed.</P>

    This time he had understood.</P>

    On the following day he did not come. Cosette only observed the fact in the evening.</P>

    "Why," said she, "Monsieur Jean has not been here today."</P>

    And she felt a slight twinge at her heart, but she hardly perceived it, being immediately diverted by a kiss from Marius.</P>

    On the following day he did not come. </P>

    Cosette paid no heed to this, passed her evening and slept well that night, as usual, and thought of it only when she woke. She was so happy! She speedily despatched Nicolette to M. Jean's house to inquire whether he were ill, and why he had not come on the previous evening. Nicolette brought back the reply of M. Jean that he was not ill. He was busy. He would come soon. As soon as he was able. Moreover, he was on the point of taking a little journey. Madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time. They were not to worry about him. They were not to think of him.</P>

    Nicolette on entering M. Jean's had repeated to him her mistress' very words. That Madame had sent her to inquire why M. Jean bad not come on the preceding evening."--It is two days since I have been there," said Jean Valjean gently.</P>

    But the remark passed unnoticed by Nicolette, who did not report it to Cosette.</P>

    这是最后一次了。这最后的微光一过，就出现了完全的熄灭。不再有亲近的表示，见面问好时不再接吻，不再听到“父亲”这个非常温暖的称呼了！是他，按照自己的要求和自己计划好的，接连把自己的一切幸福赶走；他受的苦难是在一天之内先是整个地失去珂赛特，后来还得一点一点地失去她。</P>

    眼睛已经对地窖里的光线习惯了。总之，每天见珂赛特一面，他已感到满足。他的生活都集中在这一刻里。他坐在她身旁，静静地望着她，或者和她谈谈过去的那些年，她的童年时期，她在修女院的情景和她那时的小朋友。</P>

    有一天下午棗在四月初，天气已经暖了，但还有点凉意，正是阳光明媚的时刻，马吕斯和珂赛特窗外的花园已经苏醒，山楂花即将开放，一排紫罗兰艳丽得象宝石，在老墙上开放，粉红的狼嘴花在石缝里张着大口，小白菊和金毛莨可爱地出现在绿草丛中，今年的白蝴蝶也初次露面。风，这个天长地久的喜事吹鼓手，在树林中开始演奏晨曦的大交响乐，老诗人则称之为新春。马吕斯向珂赛特说：“我们说过要去看看我们卜吕梅街的花园，这就去吧，别成为忘恩负义的人。”于是他俩就去了，好象两只燕子飞向春天一样。他们感到这卜吕梅街的花园好象他们的黎明。他们已在生活里留下了某种类似爱情的春天的东西。卜吕梅街的房子原有租赁契约，现在还属于珂赛特。他们到那个花园和房屋里去。他们又在那儿聚首，并在那里忘记了一切。晚上，在惯常的时刻，冉阿让来到受难修女街。“夫人和先生一同出去了，还没有回来。”巴斯克向他说。他静坐等了一小时，珂赛特还没有回来。他低下头就走了。珂赛特对这次重访“他们的花园”心醉神迷，并且为“整整一天生活在她的过去”而非常快乐，第二天她除了这件事之外没谈过别的，她没有注意到她没有见到冉阿让。</P>

    “你们是怎么去的？”冉阿让问她。</P>

    “走去的。”</P>

    “回来呢？”</P>

    “坐街车。”</P>

    近来，冉阿让注意到年轻的夫妇在节俭过日子，他为此感到烦恼。节俭是马吕斯严格遵守的，而这个词对冉阿让则完全有它的意义。他试探着问了一句：</P>

    “为什么你们不自备一辆车呢？一辆漂亮的轿式马车一个月只花五百法郎，你们是富裕的。”</P>

    “我不知道。”珂赛特回答。</P>

    “就拿杜桑来说吧，”冉阿让说，“她走了，您也不添个人，为什么？”</P>

    “有妮珂莱特就够了。”</P>

    “您应该有一个收拾房间的女仆呀。”</P>

    “我不是有马吕斯吗？”</P>

    “你们应该有自己的房子，自己的仆人，一辆马车和戏院里的包厢，对您来说没有一样东西会太过分的。为什么不利用你们的财富？财富是增添幸福的呀！”</P>

    珂赛特不作声。</P>

    冉阿让来访的时间并没有缩短，恰好相反，如果心在向下滑，就不会在坡上停住。</P>

    当冉阿让想延长他的访问而使人忘却时间时，他就称赞马吕斯；他觉得他是美男子，高贵、勇敢、有智慧、有口才、心地好。珂赛特更加以补充。冉阿让重又开始赞颂，简直说不完。马吕斯，这个名字的涵义是无穷无尽的，六个字母拼成的名字包含好几本书的内容。这样冉阿让就能多待一会儿。看到珂赛特在他身旁忘记一切，这对他是何等的温暖！这是他伤口的敷料。好几次巴斯克一连通知两遍：“吉诺曼先生叫我提醒男爵夫人，晚餐已经准备好了。”</P>

    在这些日子里，冉阿让就心事重重地回家去。</P>

    马吕斯曾想到把他比作蝶蛹，难道其中有着真实的一面？</P>

    冉阿让难道是个蝶蛹，它坚持不懈地来看望他的蝴蝶？</P>

    有一天他比往常还待得久一点。第二天他注意到火炉里没有生火。“咦！”他在想，“没有火了。”他自己又这样解释：“很简单，已经到了四月。冷天已经过去了！”</P>

    “上帝！这里真冷！”珂赛特进来时喊着。</P>

    “不冷嘛！”冉阿让说。</P>

    “那么是您叫巴斯克不要生火的？”</P>

    “是的，我们快到五月了。”</P>

    “但我们到六月还要生火。在这地窖里，全年都得生火。”</P>

    “我认为不要火了。”</P>

    “这又是您的怪主意！”珂赛特说。</P>

    第二天，火又生起了。但那两把扶手椅摆到门口去了。</P>

    “这是什么意思？”冉阿让思忖着。</P>

    他去把椅子搬过来放在火炉旁。</P>

    重新燃起的炉火给了他勇气。他使他们的谈天又比平时长了一点。当他站起来要走时，珂赛特说：</P>

    “昨天我的丈夫和我谈了一桩怪事。”</P>

    “什么事？”</P>

    “他和我说：‘珂赛特，我们有三万利弗的年金，你有二万七千，外祖父给我三千。’我说：‘一共有三万。’他又说：‘你有勇气用那三千法郎生活吗？’我回答说：‘可以，没有钱也行，只要和你在一起。’事后我问他：‘为什么你对我说这些话？’他回答我：‘为了想了解一下。’”</P>

    冉阿让找不到话可说。珂赛特大概等着他的解释，他忧郁地静听着。他回到武人街；由于全神贯注在这件事上致使他走错大门。他没有进入自己的家，却走进了隔壁的房子，几乎走到了三楼才发觉自己错了，这才又折了回来。 </P>

    此外冉阿让开始隐约感到主人有逐客之意。</P>

    下一天，他走进地下室时感到一阵震惊，扶手椅不见了，连一把普通的椅子也没有。</P>

    “啊，怎么啦！”珂赛特进来叫着，“没有扶手椅了，到哪去了？”</P>

    “它们不在了。”冉阿让回答。</P>

    “这太不象话！”</P>

    冉阿让结结巴巴地说：</P>

    “是我叫巴斯克搬走的。”</P>

    “原因是什么？”</P>

    “今天我只呆几分钟。”</P>

    “呆一会儿也没有理由要站着。”</P>

    “我想巴斯克客厅里需要扶手椅吧！”</P>

    “为什么？”</P>

    “你们今晚可能有客人。”</P>

    “今晚一个客人也没有。”</P>

    冉阿让再没有话可说了。</P>

    珂赛特耸耸肩。</P>

    “叫人把扶手椅搬走！那天又叫人熄火，您真古怪。”</P>

    “再见。”冉阿让轻声说。</P>

    他没有说：“再见，珂赛特。”但也没有勇气说：“再见，夫人。”</P>

    他心情沉重地走了出来。</P>

    这一次他明白了。</P>

    第二天他没有来。珂赛特到了晚上才发觉。</P>

    “咦，”她说，“今天让先生没有来。”</P>

    她心中有点抑郁，但并不明显，马吕斯的一吻就使她忘了此事。</P>

    以后的日子，他也没有再来。</P>

    珂赛特没有注意，她度过她的晚上，睡她的觉，好象平时一样，只在醒来时才想到。她是如此幸福！她很快就差妮珂莱特到让先生家去问问是否病了，为什么昨晚没有来。妮珂莱特带回让先生的回话，他一点没有病。他很忙，他很快就会来，他尽量早点来。再说，他要出去作一次短期的旅行。夫人应该记得他的习惯是不时要出去作一次旅行的，不要为他担心，不要惦记他。</P>

    当妮珂莱特走进让先生家时，她把她主妇的原话向他重复一遍：“夫人叫我来问问为什么让先生昨晚没有来。”“我两天没有去了。”冉阿让和气地说。</P>

    但他提到的这一点，妮珂莱特并没有记住，回去也没有对珂赛特说。</P>

 Part 5 Book 8 Chapter 4 Attraction and Extinction

    During the last months of spring and the first months of summer in 1833, the rare passersby in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, the loungers on thresholds, noticed an old man neatly clad in black, who emerged every day at the same hour, towards nightfall, from the Rue de l'Homme Arme, on the side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, passed in front of the Blancs Manteaux, gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and, on arriving at the Rue de l'Echarpe, turned to the left, and entered the Rue Saint-Louis. </P>

    There he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemed to be a star to him, which never varied, and which was no other than the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The nearer he approached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up; a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora, he had a fascinated and much affected air, his lips indulged in obscure movements, as though he were talking to some one whom he did not see, he smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible. One would have said that, while desirous of reaching his destination, he feared the moment when he should be close at hand. When only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened, to such a degree that, at times, one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all. The vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole. Whatever time he spent on arriving, he was obliged to arrive at last; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he halted, he trembled, he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house, and gazed into that street, and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible, and the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him. Then a tear, which had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids, and had become large enough to fall, trickled down his cheek, and sometimes stopped at his mouth. The old man tasted its bitter flavor. Thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone, then he returned by the same road and with the same step, and, in proportion as he retreated, his glance died out.</P>

    Little by little, this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis; sometimes a little further off, sometimes a little nearer. </P>

    One day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine and looked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance. Then he shook his head slowly from right to left, as though refusing himself something, and retraced his steps.</P>

    Soon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis. He got as far as the Rue Pavee, shook his head and turned back; then he went no further than the Rue des Trois-Pavillons; then he did not overstep the Blancs-Manteaux. One would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up, and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether.</P>

    Every day he emerged from his house at the same hour, he undertook the same trip, but he no longer completed it, and, perhaps without himself being aware of the fact, he constantly shortened it. His whole countenance expressed this single idea: What is the use?-- His eye was dim; no more radiance. His tears were also exhausted; they no longer collected in the corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful eye was dry. The old man's head was still craned forward; his chin moved at times; the folds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold. Sometimes, when the weather was bad, he had an umbrella under his arm, but he never opened it.</P>

    The good women of the quarter said: "He is an innocent." The children followed him and laughed.</P>

    在一八三三年晚春和初夏的时候，沼泽区稀少的过路人，店里的商人，站在门口的闲人，都注意到一个穿着整洁的黑色服装的老人，每天黄昏在一定的时候，从武人街出来，靠圣十字架街那一边，走过白大衣商店，经圣卡特琳园地街，到披肩街，再向左转走进圣路易街。</P>

    到了这里他就放慢脚步，头冲向前，什么也看不见，什么也听不到，目不转睛地注视着一个目标，这对他是一个星光闪烁的地方，这不是别的，就是受难修女街的转角。他越走近这条街的拐角，他的眼睛就越射出光芒，某种欢乐，好象内在的晨曦，使他眼珠发亮，他的神情象是被吸引，又象被感动，他的嘴唇微微颤动着，好象在向一个看不见的人说话，他恍惚在微笑，于是他尽量越走越慢。好象他一方面想走到，同时又怕已走得太近。当他离这条好象吸引他的街只有几幢房子远的地方，他的脚步缓慢得有时会使人以为他并不在走。他的头摇摆着，目光固定，好象指南针在寻找两极。虽然他拖延到达的时间，但终究也到了；到了受难修女街后，就停下来，浑身发抖，带着一种忧郁的胆怯神气，把头从最后一幢房屋的角落里伸出来，望着这条街，他那凄惨的目光好象因一件办不到的事而眼花，又好象是关闭了的天堂的反射。于是一滴眼泪，一点一点地积聚在眼角上，聚成了大泪珠就掉下来，流在腮上，有时停在嘴角边。老人尝到了泪水的苦味。他这样待上几分钟，好象石头人一样；后来他又走原路回去，以同样的步伐，越走越远，他的目光也随之暗淡下来。</P>

    慢慢地，这老人已不再走到受难修女街的拐角上，他停在圣路易街的半路上；有时远一点，有时近一点。有一天，他停在圣卡特琳园地街的拐角上，远远望着受难修女街。接着他静静地摇着头，好象拒绝自己的一点要求，就折了回去。</P>

    不久，他连圣路易街也走不到了。他走到铺石街，摇摇脑袋就往回走；后来他不超过三亭街；最后他不超过白大衣商店；好比一个没有拧上发条的钟，钟摆摇晃的距离逐渐缩短，在等待完全的停止。</P>

    天他在同一时间走出家门，他开始他的原路程，但不再走完，也许他不自觉地不断在缩短。他整个面部表情说明了这惟一的想法：何苦来呢！眼睛已没有神，没有光彩；泪珠也已干了，它不再积在眼角上；沉思的眼睛是干涩的，老人的头却总是冲向前；下巴有时摆动；可怜他脖子瘦得打皱。有时天气不好，他手臂下挟着一把伞，他从不打开，那个地区的妇女说：</P>

    “这是个傻子。”孩子们跟在他后面笑。</P>

 Part 5 Book 9 Chapter 1 Pity for the Unhappy, but Indulgence for the Happy

    It is a terrible thing to be happy! How content one is! How all-sufficient one finds it! How, being in possession of the false object of life, happiness, one forgets the true object, duty! Let us say, however, that the reader would do wrong were he to blame Marius. Marius, as we have explained, before his marriage, had put no questions to M. Fauchelevent, and, since that time, he had feared to put any to Jean Valjean. He had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn. He had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair. He had confined himself to gradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him, as much as possible, from Cosette's mind. He had, in a manner, always placed himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that, in this way, she would not perceive nor think of the latter. It was more than effacement, it was an eclipse.</P>

    Marius did what he considered necessary and just. He thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen, and others which will be seen later on, for getting rid of Jean Valjean without harshness, but without weakness.</P>

    Chance having ordained that he should encounter, in a case which he had argued, a former employee of the Laffitte establishment, he had acquired mysterious information, without seeking it, which he had not been able, it is true, to probe, out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard, and out of consideration for Jean Valjean's perilous position. He believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform: the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion. In the meanwhile, he abstained from touching that money.</P>

    As for Cosette, she had not been initiated into any of these secrets; but it would be harsh to condemn her also. </P>

    There existed between Marius and her an all-powerful magnetism, which caused her to do, instinctively and almost mechanically, what Marius wished. She was conscious of Marius' will in the direction of "Monsieur Jean," she conformed to it. Her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions, and obeyed blindly. Her obedience in this instance consisted in not remembering what Marius forgot. She was not obliged to make any effort to accomplish this. Without her knowing why herself, and without his having any cause to accuse her of it, her soul had become so wholly her husband's that that which was shrouded in gloom in Marius' mind became overcast in hers.</P>

    Let us not go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial. She was rather heedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father; but she loved her husband still more dearly. This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart, which leaned to one side only.</P>

    It sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean and expressed her surprise. Then Marius calmed her: "He is absent, I think. Did not he say that he was setting out on a journey?"--"That is true," thought Cosette. "He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion. But not for so long." Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in the Rue de l'Homme Arme whether M. Jean had returned from his journey. Jean Valjean caused the answer "no" to be given. </P>

    Cosette asked nothing more, since she had but one need on earth, Marius. </P>

    Let us also say that, on their side, Cosette and Marius had also been absent. They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette to his father's grave.</P>

    Marius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed it.</P>

    Moreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, the ingratitude of children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have elsewhere said, "looks before her." Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing. Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towards the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, and involuntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first insensible, increases slowly, like all separations of branches. The boughs, without becoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It is no fault of theirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love. Old age goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other, but there is no longer a close connection. Young people feel the cooling off of life; old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor children.</P>

    幸福的人们不免心狠！自己是多么满足！此外就一无所需了！当他们得到了幸福这个人生的假目的之后，竟把天职这个真目的忘掉了！</P>

    然而，说到这事，如果去责怪马吕斯那是不公正的。</P>

    马吕斯，我们已经解释过，在结婚前没有盘问过割风先生，此后，他又怕去盘问冉阿让。他对他被动地答应下的诺言感到后悔。他多次感到对失望者的让步是错误的。他只能慢慢地使冉阿让离开他的家，并尽力使珂赛特忘记他。他设法常使自己处于珂赛特和冉阿让之间，这样她肯定不会再看到冉阿让，也不会再去想他。这比忘却更进一步，这等于是消失了。</P>

    马吕斯做他认为必须要做的和公正的事，他觉得他有充分理由采取不生硬和坚决的措施摆脱冉阿让，有些理由很重要，这我们已经知道，还有其他的以后我们还将知道。他偶然在他辩护的一件讼事中遇到一个拉菲特银行过去的职员，他没有去寻找就得到了一些保密的材料，这些材料确实是他无法深究的，因为他要遵守他不泄密的诺言，又要顾到冉阿让的危险处境。他认为，此刻他有一件重要的任务要完成，这就是把这六十万法郎归还他在尽量审慎地寻找的原主。目前他不动用此款。</P>

    至于珂赛特，她对这些秘密一无所知；要责备她，也未免太苛刻了。</P>

    在马吕斯和她之间有一种最强的磁力，能使她出自本能或几乎机械地照马吕斯的愿望行事。她感到对“让先生”，马吕斯有一定的主意；她就顺从。她的丈夫不用向她说什么，她感到了他那虽没说出但很明显的意图的压力而盲从他。她的服从主要在于不去回忆马吕斯已忘却的事。她毫不费力地做到了。她自己也不知为什么，对此也无可谴责，她的心已变得和丈夫的毫无区别，因此马吕斯思想里被阴影遮蔽的东西，在她思想里也变得暗淡了。</P>

    然而我们也不必过多地去追究、对冉阿让，这种忘怀和删除只是表面的。她主要是由于疏忽而不是忘记。其实，她很爱这个很久以来就被她称作父亲的人。但她更爱她的丈夫。因此在她内心的天平上有点向一边倾斜的现象。</P>

    有时珂赛特谈起了冉阿让而感到诧异，于是马吕斯安慰她说：“我想他不在家，他不是说要去旅行吗？”“不错，”珂赛特暗想，“他是经常这样离开的。但不会这么久。”她曾打发妮珂莱特到武人街去过两三次，问问让先生旅行回来了没有。冉阿让关照回答说没有。</P>

    珂赛特不再多问，她在世上唯一所需的人是马吕斯。</P>

    我们还要谈到，马吕斯和珂赛特他们也曾离开过家，他们到过维尔农。马吕斯带珂赛特去上他父亲的坟。</P>

    马吕斯慢慢地使珂赛特摆脱了冉阿让，珂赛特听从他的摆布。</P>

    此外，人们在某些情况下说孩子们忘恩负义，也是过于严厉的，其实这并不象人所想的那样有罪。这种忘怀是属于自然现象。自然，我们在别处提到过，这就是“向前观望”。自然把众生分为到达的和离去的两种。离去的面向阴暗，到达的则向着光明。从这里产生的距离对老人是不利的，而在青年方面则是属于无意识。这种距离，在初期还感觉不到，慢慢地扩展下去就好比树的分枝，细枝虽不脱离树干，但已逐渐远离。这不是他们的过错。青年趋向欢乐、节日、炫目的光彩和爱情，而老人则趋向尽头。虽然互相见面，但已失去紧密的联系。生活使年轻人的感情淡漠，而坟墓则冲淡老年人的感情。不要错怪这些无辜的孩子们。</P>

 Part 5 Book 9 Chapter 2 Last Flickerings of a Lamp Without Oil

    One day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three steps in the street, seated himself on a post, on that same stone post where Gavroche had found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the 6th of June; he remained there a few moments, then went up stairs again. This was the last oscillation of the pendulum. On the following day he did not leave his apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave his bed.</P>

    His portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed: "But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!" </P>

    "Certainly I did," replied Jean Valjean. </P>

    "The plate is quite full." </P>

    "Look at the water jug. It is empty." </P>

    "That proves that you have drunk; it does not prove that you have eaten."</P>

    "Well," said Jean Valjean, "what if I felt hungry only for water?" </P>

    "That is called thirst, and, when one does not eat at the same time, it is called fever." </P>

    "I will eat to-morrow."</P>

    "Or at Trinity day. Why not to-day? Is it the thing to say: I will eat to-morrow'? The idea of leaving my platter without even touching it! My ladyfinger potatoes were so good!" </P>

    Jean Valjean took the old woman's hand: </P>

    "I promise you that I will eat them," he said, in his benevolent voice.</P>

    "I am not pleased with you," replied the portress.</P>

    Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. There are streets in Paris through which no one ever passes, and houses to which no one ever comes. He was in one of those streets and one of those houses.</P>

    While he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, for a few sous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite his bed. That gibbet is always good to look at. </P>

    A week passed, and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room. He still remained in bed. The portress said to her husband:--"The good man upstairs yonder does not get up, he no longer eats, he will not last long. That man has his sorrows, that he has. You won't get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage."</P>

    The porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty: </P>

    "If he's rich, let him have a doctor. If he is not rich, let him go without. If he has no doctor he will die." </P>

    "And if he has one?" </P>

    "He will die," said the porter. </P>

    The portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her pavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the blades, she grumbled:</P>

    "It's a shame. Such a neat old man! He's as white as a chicken." </P>

    She caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of the street; she took it upon herself to request him to come up stairs.</P>

    "It's on the second floor," said she. "You have only to enter. As the good man no longer stirs from his bed, the door is always unlocked."</P>

    The doctor saw Jean Valjean and spoke with him. </P>

    When he came down again the portress interrogated him: </P>

    "Well, doctor?" </P>

    "Your sick man is very ill indeed."</P>

    "What is the matter with him?"</P>

    "Everything and nothing. He is a man who, to all appearances, has lost some person who is dear to him. People die of that." </P>

    "What did he say to you?" </P>

    "He told me that he was in good health."</P>

    "Shall you come again, doctor?"</P>

    "Yes," replied the doctor. "But some one else besides must come."</P>

    有一天冉阿让下楼，在街上走了两三步后，在一块界石上坐了下来。六月五日至六日的那天晚上，伽弗洛什就是看到他坐在这块石块上沉思的；他在这儿待了几分钟，又上楼去了。这是钟摆最后的摇晃。第二天他没出房门。第三天，他没下床。</P>

    他的门房，替他做简单的饭菜，一点蔬菜或几个土豆加点猪油，她看看棕色的陶土盘叫道：</P>

    “怎么您昨天没有吃东西，可怜的好人！”</P>

    “吃了。”冉阿让回答。</P>

    “碟子是满的。”</P>

    “您看那水罐，它空了。”</P>

    “这说明您只喝了水，这并不等于吃了饭。”</P>

    冉阿让说：“我要是只想喝水呢？”</P>

    “这叫做口渴，如果不同时进餐，这就叫发烧。”</P>

    “我明天吃。”</P>

    “或者在圣三节吃。为什么今天不吃呢？难道有这种说法：‘我明天吃！’把我做的菜整盘都剩下！我烧的白菜味道好着呢！”</P>

    冉阿让握着老妇人的手：</P>

    “我答应您吃掉它。”他用和善的语气对她说。</P>

    “我对您很不满意。”看门的回答。</P>

    冉阿让除了这个妇人之外，很少见到其他人。巴黎有些无人走过的街道和无人进去的房屋。他住的就是这样的街道和这样的房屋。</P>

    当他还能上街时，他从锅匠那儿用几个苏买到一个小的铜十字架，挂在床前钉子上。望着这个绞刑架总是有益的。</P>

    一个星期过去了，冉阿让没有在房里走动一步。他老是躺着。看门的对她丈夫说：“上面的老人不起床了，也不吃东西，他活不多久了。他很难过。我非常相信他的女儿一定嫁得不好。”</P>

    看门的男人用丈夫的权威口气回答说：</P>

    “要是他有钱，就该请医生来看看。如果没钱，他就没有医生。如果没有医生，他就得死去。”</P>

    “如果他有一个呢？”</P>

    “他也会死的。”看门的男人说。</P>

    看门的女人用一把旧刀，把门前被她称作是她的铺路石石缝里长出的青草除去，一边除一边嘟囔着：</P>

    “可怜，一个这样正直的老人！他清白得象子鸡一样。”</P>

    她看见街末一个本区的医生走过，就自作主张请他上楼。</P>

    “在三楼，”她向他说，“您进去好了。那老人睡在床上不能动了，钥匙一直插在门上锁眼里。”</P>

    医生看了冉阿让，并和他说了话。</P>

    当他下楼后，看门的女人问他：</P>

    “怎么样，医生？”</P>

    “您的病人病得厉害。”</P>

    “是什么病？”</P>

    “什么病都有，但又没有病。看来这人失去了一个亲人，这会送命的。”</P>

    “他对您说些什么？”</P>

    “他说他身体很好。”</P>

    “您还来吗，医生？”</P>

    “来，”医生回答，“但需要另一个人回来。”</P>

 Part 5 Book 9 Chapter 4 A Bottle of Ink Which Only Succeeded in Whitening

    That same day, or to speak more accurately, that same evening, as Marcus Left the table, and was on the point of withdrawing to his study, Having a case to look over, Basque handed him a letter saying: "The person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber." </P>

    Cossets had taken the grandfather's arm and were strolling in the garden.</P>

    A letter, like a man, may have an unprepossessing exterior. Coarse paper, coarsely folded--the very sight of certain missives Is displeasing.</P>

    The letter, which Basque had brought, was of this sort.</P>

    Marius took it. It smelled of tobacco. Nothing evokes a memory like an odor. Marius recognized that tobacco. He looked at the superscription: "To Monsieur, Monsieur le Baron Pommerci. At his hotel." The recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well. It may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes. </P>

    Marius was, as it were, illuminated by one of these flashes.</P>

    The sense of smell, that mysterious aid to memory, had just revived a whole world within him. This was certainly the paper, the fashion of folding, the dull tint of ink; it was certainly the well-known handwriting, especially was it the same tobacco.</P>

    The Jondrette garret rose before his mind.</P>

    Thus, strange freak of chance! One of the two scents which he had so diligently sought, the one in connection with which he had lately again exerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost, had come and presented itself to him of its own accord.</P>

    He eagerly broke the seal, and read:</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron:--If the Supreme Being had given me the talents, I might have been baron Thenard, member of the Institute [academy of ciences], but I am not. I only bear the same as him, happy if this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses. The benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle. I am in possession of a secret concerning an individual. This individual concerns you. I hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you. I will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family that individual who has no right there, madame la baronne being of lofty birth.The sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabit longer with crime without abdicating.</P>

    I awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron. "With respect."</P>

    The letter was signed "Thenard." </P>

    This signature was not false. It was merely a trifle abridged.</P>

    Moreover, the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation. The certificate of origin was complete. </P>

    Marius' emotion was profound. After a start of surprise, he underwent a feeling of happiness. If he could now but find that other man of whom he was in search, the man who had saved him, Marius, there would be nothing left for him to desire.</P>

    He opened the drawer of his secretary, took out several bank-notes, put them in his pocket, closed the secretary again, and rang the bell. Basque half opened the door.</P>

    "Show the man in," said Marius.</P>

    Basque announced:</P>

    "Monsieur Thenard."</P>

    A man entered.</P>

    A fresh surprise for Marius. The man who entered was an utter stranger to him.</P>

    This man, who was old, moreover, had a thick nose, his chin swathed in a cravat, green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes, and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in "high life." His hair was gray. He was dressed in black from head to foot, in garments that were very threadbare but clean; a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a watch. He held in his hand an old hat! He walked in a bent attitude, and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow. </P>

    The first thing that struck the observer was, that this personage's coat, which was too ample although carefully buttoned, had not been made for him.</P>

    Here a short digression becomes necessary.</P>

    There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue Beautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was to change villains into honest men. Not for too long, which might have proved embarrassing for the villain. The change was on sight, for a day or two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible. This costumer was called "the Changer"; the pickpockets of Paris had given him this name and knew him by no other. He had a tolerably complete wardrobe. The rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable. He had specialties and categories; on each nail of his shop hung a social status, threadbare and worn; here the suit of a magistrate, there the outfit of a Cure, beyond the outfit of a banker, in one corner the costume of a retired military man, elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters, and further on the dress of a statesman. </P>

    This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in Paris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into which roguery retreated. A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room, deposited his thirty sous and selected, according to the part which he wished to play, the costume which suited him, and on descending the stairs once more, the knave was a somebody. On the following day, the clothes were faithfully returned, and the Changer, who trusted the thieves with everything, was never robbed. There was one inconvenience about these clothes, they "did not fit"; not having been made for those who wore them, they were too tight for one, too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer's costumes. It was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean. The changer had foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand, who is neither stout nor thin, neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the Changer's clients extricated themselves as best they might. So much the worse for the exceptions! The suit of the statesman, for instance, black from head to foot, and consequently proper, would have been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. The costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the Changer's catalogue; we copy:</P>

    "A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, boots and linen." On the margin there stood: ex-ambassador, and a note which we also copy: "In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green glasses, seals, and two small quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton." All this belonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole costume was, if we may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams were white, a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast; but this was only detail; as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent button. </P>

    If Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris, he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom Basque had just shown in, the statesman's suit borrowed from the pick-me-down-that shop of the Changer.</P>

    Marius' disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he expected to see turned to the newcomer's disadvantage. </P>

    He surveyed him from head to foot, while that personage made exaggerated bows, and demanded in a curt tone: </P>

    "What do you want?" </P>

    The man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a crocodile will furnish some idea: </P>

    "It seems to me impossible that I should not have already had the honor of seeing Monsieur le Baron in society. I think I actually did meet monsieur personally, several years ago, at the house of Madame la Princesse Bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his Lordship the Vicomte Dambray, peer of France."</P>

    It is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize some one whom one does not know. </P>

    Marius paid attention to the manner of this man's speech. He spied on his accent and gesture, but his disappointment increased; the pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry, shrill tone which he had expected.</P>

    He was utterly routed.</P>

    "I know neither Madame Bagration nor M. Dambray," said he. "I have never set foot in the house of either of them in my life." </P>

    The reply was ungracious. The personage, determined to be gracious at any cost, insisted.</P>

    "Then it must have been at Chateaubriand's that I have seen Monsieur! I know Chateaubriand very well. He is very affable. He sometimes says to me: Thenard, my friend . . . won't you drink a glass of wine with me?'"</P>

    Marius' brow grew more and more severe:</P>

    "I have never had the honor of being received by M. de Chateaubriand. Let us cut it short. What do you want?"</P>

    The man bowed lower at that harsh voice.</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, deign to listen to me. There is in America, in a district near Panama, a village called la Joya. That village is composed of a single house, a large, square house of three stories, built of bricks dried in the sun, each side of the square five hundred feet in length, each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below, in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of the edifice, in the centre an inner court where the provisions and munitions are kept; no windows, loopholes, no doors, ladders, ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace, and from the first to the second, and from the second to the third, ladders to descend into the inner court, no doors to the chambers, trap-doors, no staircases to the chambers, ladders; in the evening the traps are closed, the ladders are withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes; no means of entering, a house by day, a citadel by night, eight hundred inhabitants,-- that is the village. Why so many precautions? because the country is dangerous; it is full of cannibals. Then why do people go there? because the country is marvellous; gold is found there." </P>

    "What are you driving at?" interrupted Marius, who had passed from disappointment to impatience. </P>

    "At this, Monsieur le Baron. I am an old and weary diplomat. Ancient civilization has thrown me on my own devices. I want to try savages."</P>

    "Well?"</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, egotism is the law of the world. The proletarian peasant woman, who toils by the day, turns round when the diligence passes by, the peasant proprietress, who toils in her field, does not turn round. The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man, the dog of the rich man barks at the poor man. Each one for himself. Self-interest--that's the object of men. Gold, that's the loadstone."</P>

    "What then? Finish."</P>

    "I should like to go and establish myself at la Joya. There are three of us. I have my spouse and my young lady; a very beautiful girl. The journey is long and costly. I need a little money." </P>

    "What concern is that of mine?" demanded Marius.</P>

    The stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat, a gesture characteristic of the vulture, and replied with an augmented smile. </P>

    "Has not Monsieur le Baron perused my letter?"</P>

    There was some truth in this. The fact is, that the contents of the epistle had slipped Marius' mind. He had seen the writing rather than read the letter. He could hardly recall it. But a moment ago a fresh start had been given him. He had noted that detail: "my spouse and my young lady."</P>

    He fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger. An examining judge could not have done the look better. He almost lay in wait for him. </P>

    He confined himself to replying: </P>

    "State the case precisely." </P>

    The stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs, drew himself up without straightening his dorsal column, but scrutinizing Marius in his turn, with the green gaze of his spectacles. </P>

    "So be it, Monsieur le Baron. I will be precise. I have a secret to sell to you."</P>

    "A secret?"</P>

    "A secret."</P>

    "Which concerns me?"</P>

    "Somewhat."</P>

    "What is the secret?"</P>

    Marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him. </P>

    "I commence gratis," said the stranger. "You will see that I am interesting."</P>

    "Speak."</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, you have in your house a thief and an assassin."</P>

    Marius shuddered.</P>

    "In my house? no," said he.</P>

    The imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on:</P>

    "An assassin and a thief. Remark, Monsieur le Baron, that I do not here speak of ancient deeds, deeds of the past which have lapsed, which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before God. I speak of recent deeds, of actual facts as still unknown to justice at this hour. I continue. This man has insinuated himself into your confidence, and almost into your family under a false name. I am about to tell you his real name. And to tell it to you for nothing."</P>

    "I am listening."</P>

    "His name is Jean Valjean."</P>

    "I know it."</P>

    "I am going to tell you, equally for nothing, who he is."</P>

    "Say on."</P>

    "He is an ex-convict."</P>

    "I know it."</P>

    "You know it since I have had the honor of telling you."</P>

    "No. I knew it before."</P>

    Marius' cold tone, that double reply of "I know it," his laconicism, which was not favorable to dialogue, stirred up some smouldering wrath in the stranger. He launched a furious glance on the sly at Marius, which was instantly extinguished. Rapid as it was, this glance was of the kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it; it did not escape Marius. Certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls; the eye, that vent-hole of the thought, glows with it; spectacles hide nothing; try putting a pane of glass over hell!</P>

    The stranger resumed with a smile:</P>

    "I will not permit myself to contradict Monsieur le Baron. In any case, you ought to perceive that I am well informed. Now what I have to tell you is known to myself alone. This concerns the fortune of Madame la Baronne. It is an extraordinary secret. It is for sale-- I make you the first offer of it. Cheap. Twenty thousand francs." </P>

    "I know that secret as well as the others," said Marius.</P>

    The personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle.</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, say ten thousand francs and I will speak."</P>

    "I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me. I know what you wish to say to me."</P>

    A fresh flash gleamed in the man's eye. He exclaimed:</P>

    "But I must dine to-day, nevertheless. It is an extraordinary secret, I tell you. Monsieur le Baron, I will speak. I speak. Give me twenty francs."</P>

    Marius gazed intently at him:</P>

    "I know your extraordinary secret, just as I knew Jean Valjean's name, just as I know your name."</P>

    "My name?"</P>

    "Yes."</P>

    "That is not difficult, Monsieur le Baron. I had the honor to write to you and to tell it to you. Thenard." </P>

    "--Dier."</P>

    "Hey?"</P>

    "Thenardier."</P>

    "Who's that?"</P>

    In danger the porcupine bristles up, the beetle feigns death, the old guard forms in a square; this man burst into laughter. </P>

    Then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a fillip.</P>

    Marius continued:</P>

    "You are also Jondrette the workman, Fabantou the comedian, Genflot the poet, Don Alvares the Spaniard, and Mistress Balizard." </P>

    "Mistress what?"</P>

    "And you kept a pot-house at Montfermeil." </P>

    "A pot-house! Never."</P>

    "And I tell you that your name is Thenardier."</P>

    "I deny it."</P>

    "And that you are a rascal. Here."</P>

    And Marius drew a bank-note from his pocket and flung it in his face.</P>

    "Thanks! Pardon me! five hundred francs! Monsieur le Baron!"</P>

    And the man, overcome, bowed, seized the note and examined it.</P>

    "Five hundred francs!" he began again, taken aback. And he stammered in a low voice: "An honest rustler."[69]</P>

    [69] Un fafiot serieux. Fafiot is the slang term for a bank-bill, derived from its rustling noise. </P>

    Then brusquely:</P>

    "Well, so be it!" he exclaimed. "Let us put ourselves at our ease." </P>

    And with the agility of a monkey, flinging back his hair, tearing off his spectacles, and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two quills of which mention was recently made, and which the reader has also met with on another page of this book, he took off his face as the man takes off his hat.</P>

    His eye lighted up; his uneven brow, with hollows in some places and bumps in others, hideously wrinkled at the top, was laid bare, his nose had become as sharp as a beak; the fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey reappeared.</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron is infallible," he said in a clear voice whence all nasal twang had disappeared, "I am Thenardier." </P>

    And he straightened up his crooked back.</P>

    Thenardier, for it was really he, was strangely surprised; he would have been troubled, had he been capable of such a thing. He had come to bring astonishment, and it was he who had received it. This humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him, and, taking it all in all, he accepted it; but he was none the less bewildered.</P>

    He beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time, and, in spite of his disguise, this Baron Pontmercy recognized him, and recognized him thoroughly. And not only was this Baron perfectly informed as to Thenardier, but he seemed well posted as to Jean Valjean. Who was this almost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knew people's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse to them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?</P>

    Thenardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius' neighbor, had never seen him, which is not unusual in Paris; he had formerly, in a vague way, heard his daughters talk of a very poor young man named Marius who lived in the house. He had written to him, without knowing him, the letter with which the reader is acquainted.</P>

    No connection between that Marius and M. le Baron Pontmercy was possible in his mind.</P>

    As for the name Pontmercy, it will be recalled that, on the battlefield of Waterloo, he had only heard the last two syllables, for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks.</P>

    However, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent of the married pair on the 16th of February, and through his own personal researches, he had succeeded in learning many things, and, from the depths of his own gloom, he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew. He had discovered, by dint of industry, or, at least, by dint of induction, he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he had easily reached the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was Cosette. But he meant to be discreet in that quarter.</P>

    Who was Cosette? He did not know exactly himself. He did, indeed, catch an inkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine had always seemed to him equivocal; but what was the use of talking about that? In order to cause himself to be paid for his silence? He had, or thought he had, better wares than that for sale. And, according to all appearances, if he were to come and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation--and without proof: "Your wife is a bastard," the only result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer. </P>

    From Thenardier's point of view, the conversation with Mari us had not yet begun. He ought to have drawn back, to have modified his strategy, to have abandoned his position, to have changed his front; but nothing essential had been compromised as yet, and he had five hundred francs in his pocket. Moreover, he had something decisive to say, and, even against this very well-informed and well-armed Baron Pontmercy, he felt himself strong. For men of Thenardier's nature, every dialogue is a combat. In the one in which he was about to engage, what was his situation? He did not know to whom he was speaking, but he did know of what he was speaking, he made this rapid review of his inner forces, and after having said: "I am Thenardier," he waited. </P>

    Marius had become thoughtful. So he had hold of Thenardier at last. That man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him. He could honor Colonel Pontmercy's recommendation. </P>

    He felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this villain, and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father upon him, Marius, had been protested up to that day. It also seemed to him, in the complex state of his mind towards Thenardier, that there was occasion to avenge the Colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal. In any case, he was content. He was about to deliver the Colonel's shade from this unworthy creditor at last, and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his father's memory from the debtors' prison. By the side of this duty there was another-- to elucidate, if possible, the source of Cosette's fortune. The opportunity appeared to present itself. Perhaps Thenardier knew something. It might prove useful to see the bottom of this man.</P>

    He commenced with this.</P>

    Thenardier had caused the "honest rustler" to disappear in his fob, and was gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender. </P>

    Marius broke the silence.</P>

    "Thenardier, I have told you your name. Now, would you like to have me tell you your secret--the one that you came here to reveal to me? I have information of my own, also. You shall see that I know more about it than you do. Jean Valjean, as you have said, is an assassin and a thief. A thief, because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer, whose ruin he brought about. An assassin, because he assassinated police-agent Javert."</P>

    "I don't understand, sir," ejaculated Thenardier.</P>

    "I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement of the Pas de Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with justice, and who, under the name of M. Madeleine, had regained his status and rehabilitated himself. This man had become a just man in the full force of the term. In a trade, the manufacture of black glass goods, he made the fortune of an entire city. As far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also, but as a secondary matter, and in some sort, by accident. He was the foster-father of the poor. He founded hospitals, opened schools, visited the sick, dowered young girls, supported widows, and adopted orphans; he was like the guardian angel of the country. He refused the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days; he denounced him, and had him arrested, and profited by the arrest to come to Paris and cause the banker Laffitte,--I have the fact from the cashier himself,--by means of a false signature, to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to M. Madeleine. This convict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As for the other fact, you have nothing to tell me about it either. Jean Valjean killed the agent Javert; he shot him with a pistol. I, the person who is speaking to you, was present." </P>

    Thenardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory, and who has just regained, in one instant, all the ground which he has lost. But the smile returned instantly. The inferior's triumph in the presence of his superior must be wheedling.</P>

    Thenardier contented himself with saying to Marius: </P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, we are on the wrong track."</P>

    And he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an expressive whirl.</P>

    "What!" broke forth Marius, "do you dispute that? These are facts."</P>

    "They are chimeras. The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron honors me renders it my duty to tell him so. Truth and justice before all things. I do not like to see folks accused unjustly. Monsieur le Baron, Jean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean did not kill Javert."</P>

    "This is too much! How is this?"</P>

    "For two reasons."</P>

    "What are they? Speak."</P>

    "This is the first: he did not rob M. Madeleine, because it is Jean Valjean himself who was M. Madeleine." </P>

    "What tale are you telling me?"</P>

    "And this is the second: he did not assassinate Javert, because the person who killed Javert was Javert."</P>

    "What do you mean to say?"</P>

    "That Javert committed suicide."</P>

    "Prove it! Prove it!" cried Marius beside himself.</P>

    Thenardier resumed, scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient Alexandrine measure:</P>

    "Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-Change."</P>

    "But prove it!"</P>

    Thenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper, which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes. </P>

    "I have my papers," he said calmly.</P>

    And he added:</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjean thoroughly. I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and the same man, and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert. If I speak, it is because I have proofs. Not manuscript proofs-- writing is suspicious, handwriting is complaisant,--but printed proofs."</P>

    As he spoke, Thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of newspapers, yellow, faded, and strongly saturated with tobacco. One of these two newspapers, broken at every fold and falling into rags, seemed much older than the other.</P>

    "Two facts, two proofs," remarked Thenardier. And he offered the two newspapers, unfolded, to Marius, </P>

    The reader is acquainted with these two papers. One, the most ancient, a number of the Drapeau Blanc of the 25th of July, 1823, the text of which can be seen in the first volume, established the identity of M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean.</P>

    The other, a Moniteur of the 15th of June, 1832, announced the suicide of Javert, adding that it appeared from a verbal report of Javert to the prefect that, having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent who, holding him under his pistol, had fired into the air, instead of blowing out his brains. </P>

    Marius read. He had evidence, a certain date, irrefragable proof, these two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing up Thenardier's statements; the note printed in the Moniteur had been an administrative communication from the Prefecture of Police. Marius could not doubt.</P>

    The information of the cashier-clerk had been false, and he himself had been deceived.</P>

    Jean Valjean, who had suddenly grown grand, emerged from his cloud. Marius could not repress a cry of joy. </P>

    "Well, then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man! The whole of that fortune really belonged to him! He is Madeleine, the providence of a whole countryside! He is Jean Valjean, Javert's savior! He is a hero! He is a saint!" </P>

    "He's not a saint, and he's not a hero!" said Thenardier. "He's an assassin and a robber." </P>

    And he added, in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses some authority:</P>

    "Let us be calm."</P>

    Robber, assassin--those words which Marius thought had disappeared and which returned, fell upon him like an ice-cold shower-bath. </P>

    "Again!" said he.</P>

    "Always," ejaculated Thenardier. "Jean Valjean did not rob Madeleine, but he is a thief. He did not kill Javert, but he is a murderer." </P>

    "Will you speak," retorted Marius, "of that miserable theft, committed forty years ago, and expiated, as your own newspapers prove, by a whole life of repentance, of self-abnegation and of virtue?" </P>

    "I say assassination and theft, Monsieur le Baron, and I repeat that I am speaking of actual facts. What I have to reveal to you is absolutely unknown. It belongs to unpublished matter. And perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to Madame la Baronne by Jean Valjean. I say skilfully, because, by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share, and, at the same stroke, to conceal one's crime, and to enjoy one's theft, to bury one's name and to create for oneself a family." </P>

    "I might interrupt you at this point," said Marius, "but go on." </P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, I will tell you all, leaving the recompense to your generosity. This secret is worth massive gold. You will say to me: Why do not you apply to Jean Valjean?' For a very simple reason; I know that he has stripped himself, and stripped himself in your favor, and I consider the combination ingenious; but he has no longer a son, he would show me his empty hands, and, since I am in need of some money for my trip to la Joya, I prefer you, you who have it all, to him who has nothing. I am a little fatigued, permit me to take a chair."</P>

    Marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same.</P>

    Thenardier installed himself on a tufted chair, picked up his two newspapers, thrust them back into their envelope, and murmured as he pecked at the Drapeau Blanc with his nail: "It cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one." </P>

    That done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of the chair, an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they are saying, then he entered upon his subject gravely, emphasizing his words:</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, on the day of the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, at the point where the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des Invalides and the Pont de Jena."</P>

    Marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of Thenardier. Thenardier noticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator who holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under his words:</P>

    "This man, forced to conceal himself, and for reasons, moreover, which are foreign to politics, had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a key to it. It was, I repeat, on the 6th of June; it might have been eight o'clock in the evening. The man hears a noise in the sewer. Greatly surprised, he hides himself and lies in wait. It was the sound of footsteps, some one was walking in the dark, and coming in his direction. Strange to say, there was another man in the sewer besides himself. The grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off. A little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer, and to see that the man was carrying something on his back. He was walking in a bent attitude. The man who was walking in a bent attitude was an ex-convict, and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse. Assassination caught in the very act, if ever there was such a thing. As for the theft, that is understood; one does not kill a man gratis. This convict was on his way to fling the body into the river. One fact is to be noticed, that before reaching the exit grating, this convict, who had come a long distance in the sewer, must, necessarily, have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body, but the sewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day, while at work on the quagmire, and that did not suit the assassin's plans. He had preferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden, and his exertions must have been terrible, for it is impossible to risk one's life more completely; I don't understand how he could have come out of that alive." </P>

    Marius' chair approached still nearer. Thenardier took advantage of this to draw a long breath. He went on: </P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, a sewer is not the Champ de Mars. One lacks everything there, even room. When two men are there, they must meet. That is what happened. The man domiciled there and the passer-by were forced to bid each other good-day, greatly to the regret of both. The passer-by said to the inhabitant:--"You see what I have on my back, I must get out, you have the key, give it to me." That convict was a man of terrible strength. There was no way of refusing. Nevertheless, the man who had the key parleyed, simply to gain time. He examined the dead man, but he could see nothing, except that the latter was young, well dressed, with the air of being rich, and all disfigured with blood. While talking, the man contrived to tear and pull off behind, without the assassin perceiving it, a bit of the assassinated man's coat. A document for conviction, you understand; a means of recovering the trace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal. He put this document for conviction in his pocket. After which he opened the grating, made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back, closed the grating again, and ran off, not caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all, not wishing to be present when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river. Now you comprehend. The man who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean; the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment; and the piece of the coat . . ."</P>

    Thenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket, and holding, on a level with his eyes, nipped between his two thumbs and his two forefingers, a strip of torn black cloth, all covered with dark spots.</P>

    Marius had sprung to his feet, pale, hardly able to draw his breath, with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth, and, without uttering a word, without taking his eyes from that fragment, he retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney. </P>

    He found the key, opened the cupboard, plunged his arm into it without looking, and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which Thenardier still held outspread.</P>

    But Thenardier continued:</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron, I have the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by Jean Valjean, and the bearer of an enormous sum of money." </P>

    "The young man was myself, and here is the coat!" cried Marius, and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood. </P>

    Then, snatching the fragment from the hands of Thenardier, he crouched down over the coat, and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt. The rent fitted exactly, and the strip completed the coat. </P>

    Thenardier was petrified. </P>

    This is what he thought: "I'm struck all of a heap."</P>

    Marius rose to his feet trembling, despairing, radiant.</P>

    He fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to Thenardier, presenting to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with bank-notes for five hundred and a thousand francs. </P>

    "You are an infamous wretch! you are a liar, a calumniator, a villain. You came to accuse that man, you have only justified him; you wanted to ruin him, you have only succeeded in glorifying him. And it is you who are the thief! And it is you who are the assassin! I saw you, Thenardier Jondrette, in that lair on the Rue de l'Hopital. I know enough about you to send you to the galleys and even further if I choose. Here are a thousand francs, bully that you are!" </P>

    And he flung a thousand franc note at Thenardier. </P>

    "Ah! Jondrette Thenardier, vile rascal! Let this serve you as a lesson, you dealer in second-hand secrets, merchant of mysteries, rummager of the shadows, wretch! Take these five hundred francs and get out of here! Waterloo protects you."</P>

    "Waterloo!" growled Thenardier, pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand.</P>

    "Yes, assassin! You there saved the life of a Colonel. . ."</P>

    "Of a General," said Thenardier, elevating his head.</P>

    "Of a Colonel!" repeated Marius in a rage. "I wouldn't give a ha'penny for a general. And you come here to commit infamies! I tell you that you have committed all crimes. Go! Disappear! Only be happy, that is all that I desire. Ah! monster! Here are three thousand francs more. Take them. You will depart to-morrow, for America, with your daughter; for your wife is dead, you abominable liar. I shall watch over your departure, you ruffian, and at that moment I will count out to you twenty thousand francs. Go get yourself hung elsewhere!"</P>

    "Monsieur le Baron!" replied Thenardier, bowing to the very earth, "eternal gratitude." And Thenardier left the room, understanding nothing, stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold, and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in bank-bills. </P>

    Struck by lightning he was, but he was also content; and he would have been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such lightning as that.</P>

    Let us finish with this man at once. </P>

    Two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating, he set out, thanks to Marius' care, for America under a false name, with his daughter Azelma, furnished with a draft on New York for twenty thousand francs.</P>

    The moral wretchedness of Thenardier, the bourgeois who had missed his vocation, was irremediable. He was in America what he had been in Europe. Contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good action and to cause evil things to spring from it. With Marius' money, Thenardier set up as a slave-dealer. </P>

    As soon as Thenardier had left the house, Marius rushed to the garden, where Cosette was still walking. </P>

    "Cosette! Cosette!" he cried."Come! Come quick! Let us go. Basque, a carriage! Cosette, come. Ah! My God! It was he who saved my life! Let us not lose a minute! Put on your shawl." </P>

    Cosette thought him mad and obeyed.</P>

    He could not breathe, he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its throbbing. He paced back and forth with huge strides, he embraced Cosette: </P>

    "Ah! Cosette! I am an unhappy wretch!" said he. </P>

    Marius was bewildered.He began to catch a glimpse in Jean Valjean of some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure. An unheard-of virtue, supreme and sweet, humble in its immensity, appeared to him. The convict was transfigured into Christ. </P>

    Marius was dazzled by this prodigy. He did not know precisely what he beheld, but it was grand. </P>

    In an instant, a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door. </P>

    Marius helped Cosette in and darted in himself.</P>

    "Driver," said he, "Rue de l'Homme Arme, Number 7."</P>

    The carriage drove off.</P>

    "Ah! what happiness!" ejaculated Cosette. "Rue de l'Homme Arme, I did not dare to speak to you of that. We are going to see M. Jean."</P>

    "Thy father! Cosette, thy father more than ever. Cosette, I guess it. You told me that you had never received the letter that I sent you by Gavroche. It must have fallen into his hands. Cosette, he went to the barricade to save me. As it is a necessity with him to be an angel, he saved others also; he saved Javert. He rescued me from that gulf to give me to you. He carried me on his back through that frightful sewer. Ah! I am a monster of ingratitude. Cosette, after having been your providence, he became mine. Just imagine, there was a terrible quagmire enough to drown one a hundred times over, to drown one in mire. Cosette! he made me traverse it. I was unconscious; I saw nothing, I heard nothing, I could know nothing of my own adventure. We are going to bring him back, to take him with us, whether he is willing or not, he shall never leave us again. If only he is at home! Provided only that we can find him, I will pass the rest of my life in venerating him. Yes, that is how it should be, do you see, Cosette? Gavroche must have delivered my letter to him. All is explained. You understand."</P>

    Cosette did not understand a word.</P>

    "You are right," she said to him.</P>

    Meanwhile the carriage rolled on.</P>

    就在这一天，或者说得更清楚一些，就在这一晚，马吕斯吃完晚饭到回到办公室，因为有一份案卷要研究，这时巴斯克递给他一封信并且说：“写这信的人在候客室里。”</P>

    珂赛特挽着外祖父的手臂在花园里散步。</P>

    一封信，跟一个人一样，也可以有一种不端正的外表。粗糙的纸张，笨拙的折叠法，有些信只要一看就使人不高兴。巴斯克拿来的信就是属于这一类的。</P>

    马吕斯接过来，信上有一股烟叶味。没有再比一种气味更能使人回忆起往事了。马吕斯想起了这种烟味。他看信封上的地名：送给先生，彭眉胥男爵先生，他的公馆。熟悉的烟味使他认出笔迹。我们可以说惊愕是会发出闪光的，马吕斯好象被这样的一闪照得清醒了。</P>

    烟味，这神秘的备忘录，使他想起了许多事。正就是这种纸张，这种折叠方式，淡淡的墨水，熟悉的笔迹，尤其是烟味，容德雷特的破屋在他的眼前出现了。</P>

    如此奇特的巧遇！他曾再三寻找的两种踪迹之一，这是不久前他还全力以赴去寻找、后来认为永远消失了的，不料竟自己送上门来了。</P>

    他迫不及待地拆开信念着：</P>

    男爵先生：</P>

    如果上帝赐给我天才的话，我本可成为德纳男爵、院士（可学完），但是我不是。我仅和他同名，如果这件事能使我获得您的关照，我将感到荣幸。如蒙您恩赐，我将报答。我拈有一个关鱼某人的秘密。这人又与您有关。我可以把这秘密告诉您，希望能荣幸地为您福务。我奉上一个最简单的办法，把这无权留在您尊贵的家庭里的人区逐出去，男爵夫人出身是高贵的，道德的圣地不能再与罪恶童居而不有损于自身。</P>

    我在候客实等呆男爵先生的命令。</P>

    敬颂</P>

    大安</P>

    这封信的签名是“德纳”。</P>

    签的名不假，只是缩减了一点。</P>

    此外文字不知所云和别字连篇充分暴露了真情。这个身分证已经完备，不容再怀疑了。</P>

    马吕斯的情绪十分激动，惊愕之后，他感到了幸运。但愿现在再能找到他寻找的另一个人，那个救了他马吕斯的人，那么他就别无他求了。</P>

    他把写字台的抽屉打开拿出几张钞票，放入口袋，关上抽屉就按铃。巴斯克半开着门。</P>

    “带他进来。”马吕斯说。</P>

    巴斯克通报：</P>

    “德纳先生。”</P>

    一个人走了进来。</P>

    马吕斯又感到惊讶。进来的人他完全不认识。</P>

    这人年老，长着一个大鼻子，下巴隐藏在领结里，戴着绿色眼镜，加上双层绿绸遮光帽檐。头发光滑直齐眉梢，好象英国上流社会①马车夫的假发。他的头发花白。全身黑服，是一种磨损了的黑色，但还干净；一串装饰品在背心口袋上吊着，使人猜想是表链。他手里拿着一顶旧帽子，驼着背走路，鞠躬的深度使得背更驼了。 </P>

    ①上流社会，原文为英文high　life。</P>

    一见面就使人注意到这人的衣服太肥大，虽然仔细扣上纽子，仍不象是为他缝制的。</P>

    这里有必要加一点题外的话。</P>

    当时在巴黎博特莱伊街，靠近兵工厂的地方，在一所不三不四的老房子里住着一个精明的犹太人，他的职业是把一个坏蛋化装成正派人。时间不要太久，不然，坏蛋会感到拘束。这种化装立即奏效，可以维持一两天，代价是三十个苏一天，办法是穿一套与一般正派人的穿着非常相似的服装。这个服装出租者的名字叫“更换商”，这是巴黎的扒手们送给他的绰号，不知道他的真姓名叫什么。他的服装室相当齐全。他用来打扮人的那些旧衣烂衫基本上还过得去。他划分专业和类型；在他铺子的每个钉子上都挂有社会上某种地位的人的磨损和起皱的服装，这里是行政官员的服装，那里是教士的服装，那里又是银行家的服装，在一个角落里又有着退伍军人的服装，而在另一处则是文人的服装，远一点的地方还有着政界人士的服装。这个人是诈骗犯在巴黎演出大型戏剧时的化装人。他的陋室是盗贼和骗子进出的后台。一个褴褛的坏蛋走进这个服装室，放下三十个苏，挑选适合他今天要演出的角色的服装，当他走下阶梯时，这个坏蛋就已变成一个人物了。第二天，衣服又很诚实地被送回来。这个“更换商”，他把一切都信托给小偷，也从未被盗窃过。这些服装有一个缺点，“不合身”，因为不是为穿衣的人定做的，对有些人太瘦，对有些人则太肥，没有一个人穿了合身。任何一个比普通身材高大或矮小的坏蛋，穿了“更换商”的服装都感到不自在。不能太胖或太瘦，“更换商”只考虑到一般的身材。他随便找一个乞丐来量体裁衣，那个人不胖，不瘦，不高也不矮。因此要求都合身有时是困难的，只得由“更换商”的主顾自己迁就了事。特殊的身材活该倒霉！譬如政界人士的服装，上下一身黑，因此是恰当的，但皮特①穿了嫌太肥，加斯特尔西加拉②又嫌太瘦。和政界人士相称的服装在“更换商”的服装目录里标明如下，我们照抄在此：“黑呢上衣一件，黑色紧面薄呢裤一条，绸背心一件，长统靴和衬衣。”边上还写着“过去的大使”。还有注解，我们界人士，过去的大使相称。这套衣服，我们可以这样说，已经相当旧了；缝线发白，胳膊肘的某一处有一个隐约可见的扣子大小的洞，此外，前胸缺少一颗扣子；这只是一点细节；政客的手应该随时都插在衣服里靠胸的地方，它的作用就是要遮住缺少的扣子。 </P>

    ①皮特（Pitt，1708-1778），英国政治家。</P>

    ②加斯特尔西加拉（Castelcicala），那不勒斯王国驻巴黎的大使。</P>

    如果马吕斯熟悉巴黎这种隐秘的机构的话，他立刻就会认出，巴斯克引进来的客人身上所穿的政客服装就是从“更换商”那儿的钩子上租来的。</P>

    马吕斯看见进来的人并非是他所等待的人，于是感到失望，他对新来的人表示不欢迎，他从头到脚打量着他，当时这人正在深深地鞠躬，他不客气地问他：</P>

    “您有什么事？”</P>

    这人用一个亲善的露齿笑容作了回答，这笑容有点象鳄鱼的温存微笑：</P>

    “我觉得在社交界里我不可能没有荣幸见到过男爵先生。我想几年前我在巴格拉西翁公主夫人家中见到过您，还在法国贵族院议员唐勃莱子爵大人的沙龙里和您见过面。”</P>

    这些是无赖常用的策略，装出认识一个不相识的人。</P>

    马吕斯密切注意着这人的说话，琢磨着他的口音和动作，但他的失望增加了，这种带鼻音的声调，和他期待的尖锐生硬的声音完全不同，他象坠入五里雾中。</P>

    “我既不认识巴格拉西翁夫人，也不认识唐勃莱先生，”他说，“我从没去过这两家。”</P>

    他带着易怒的声调回答着。这人仍亲切地坚持说：</P>

    “那我就是在夏多勃里昂家里见到过先生！我和夏多勃里昂很熟悉，他很和气。有时他对我说：‘德纳我的朋友……你不来和我干一杯吗？’”</P>

    马吕斯的神气越来越严厉：</P>

    “我从来没有荣幸被夏多勃里昂接待过。简单地直说吧，您来干什么？”</P>

    这人听了这严酷的语气，更深深地鞠躬：</P>

    “男爵先生，请听我说，在美洲巴拿马那边一个地区，有一个村子叫若耶，这村子只有一所房子。一栋四层楼的由太阳晒干的砖所砌成的四方的大房子，四方房子的每一边有五百尺长，每层比下层退进十二尺，这样在房屋四周的前面就有一个绕屋的平台，当中是一个内院，那里堆积着粮食和武器，没有窗子，但有枪眼，没有门，但有梯子，梯子从地上架到二层平台，再从第二层架到第三层，从三层架到四层，再用梯子下到内院，房间没有门，只有吊门，房间也没有楼梯，只有梯子；夜间关上吊门拿走梯子，大口枪和马枪都在枪眼里瞄准着，无法走进去，这里白天是一所房子，晚上是一座堡垒，有八百住户，这村子就是这样的。为什么要如此小心呢？因为这是一个危险地区，有很多吃人的人，为什么人们要去呢？因为这是个绝妙的地方；那里找得到黄金。”</P>

    “您究竟要干什么？”马吕斯因失望而变得不耐烦，打断了他的话。</P>

    “我要说的是，男爵先生，我是一个疲惫的老外交家。旧文化使我厌倦，我想过过未开化的生活。”</P>

    “还有呢？”</P>

    “男爵先生，自私是世间的法律。无产的雇农看见公共马车走过就回过头去，有产的农民在自己的田里劳动就不回头。穷人的狗对着富人叫，富人的狗对着穷人叫。人人都为自己，钱财是人们追求的目的。金子是磁石。”</P>

    “还有什么话？快说完。”</P>

    “我想到若耶去安家。我们一家三口，妻子和女儿，一个很漂亮的姑娘。旅途长而旅费贵，我需要一点钱。”</P>

    “这和我有什么关系？”马吕斯问。</P>

    这不相识的人把下巴伸出领结外，好象秃鹫的动作，并用双重意味的微笑来回答。</P>

    “难道男爵先生没有读过我的信吗？”</P>

    这话有点说对了。事实上是马吕斯没有十分注意信的内容。他看到笔迹，忽略了内容。他几乎想不起来了。目前他又得到了一条新的线索。他注意到这个细节：我的妻子和女儿，他用深刻的目光盯住这个陌生人。一个审判官也不如他看得更仔细，他等于在窥伺，他只是回答：</P>

    “说清楚点。”</P>

    陌生人把两手插在背心的口袋中，抬起头但并不撑直脊背，他那通过眼镜的绿目光也在细察着马吕斯。</P>

    “好吧，男爵先生，我说清楚点。我有一个秘密向您出售。”</P>

    “一个秘密！”</P>

    “一个秘密。”</P>

    “和我有关？”</P>

    “多少有点。”</P>

    “什么秘密？”</P>

    马吕斯一边听着，同时越来越仔细观察这个人。</P>

    “我开始时不提报酬，”陌生人说，“对我所讲的您会感到很有意思。”</P>

    “说下去！”</P>

    “男爵先生，您家里有一个盗贼和一个杀人犯。”</P>

    马吕斯一阵震颤。</P>

    “在我家里？不会。”他说。</P>

    陌生人镇定地、用衣袖肘刷刷帽子，继续说：</P>

    “杀人犯和盗贼。男爵先生请注意，我这里说的并不是往事，不是过期的，失效的，不是法律的具体规定和神前忏悔可以取消的，我讲的是最近的事，眼前的事，此刻尚未被法律发现的事。我说下去。这个人骗取了您的信任，几乎钻进了您的家庭，他用了一个假名。我告诉您他的真名，我不要分文来向您说。”</P>

    “我听着。”</P>

    “他叫冉阿让。”</P>

    “我知道。”</P>

    “我告诉您他是谁，但仍不要报酬。”</P>

    “说吧！”</P>

    “他是一个老苦役犯。”</P>

    “我知道。”</P>

    “您知道是因为我荣幸地向您说了。”</P>

    “不是。我早已知道了。”</P>

    马吕斯冷冷的语气，两次“我知道”的回答，说话简短，表示不愿交谈，引起了陌生人的一点暗火。他那发怒的目光偷偷瞥了马吕斯一眼，但又立刻熄灭了。这目光虽然如此迅速，但人们只要见过一次，以后就会认出来的，而且也没逃过马吕斯的眼睛。某种火焰只能出自某些灵魂，它会烧着眼睛，这个思想的通风洞；眼镜不能遮蔽任何东西，就象在地狱前面放上一块玻璃一样。</P>

    陌生人微笑着又说：</P>

    “我不敢反驳男爵先生。总而言之，您知道我是了解实情的。现在我要告诉您的事情只有我一个人知道。这与男爵夫人的财产有关。这是一个特殊的秘密，它可以出售，我先献给您，价钱便宜，两万法郎。”</P>

    “这秘密和其他的一样，我也知道。”</P>

    那人感到需要杀点价：</P>

    “男爵先生，给一万法郎吧，我就说。”</P>

    “我再重复一遍，您没有什么可告诉我的。我已知道您要说些什么了。”</P>

    这人的眼中又闪出一道光，他大声叫喊起来：</P>

    “今天我总得要吃饭呀。我对您说，这是一个特殊的秘密。</P>

    男爵先生，我要说了，我就说。给我二十法郎好了。”</P>

    马吕斯的眼睛盯住他：</P>

    “我知道您的特殊秘密，就象我知道冉阿让的名字，也象我知道您的名字一样。”</P>

    “我的名字？”</P>

    “是的。”</P>

    “这不难，男爵先生，我荣幸地写给您了，并向您说了：德纳。”</P>

    “第。”</P>

    “什么？”</P>

    “德纳第。”</P>

    “这是谁？”</P>

    在危急之中，箭猪会竖起刺来，金龟子会装死，老看守人员会摆出架势，这人就大笑起来。</P>

    于是他用手指掸去衣袖上的一点灰尘。</P>

    马吕斯继续说：</P>

    “您也是工人容德雷特，演员法邦杜，诗人尚弗洛，西班牙贵人堂·阿尔瓦内茨，又是妇人巴利查儿。”</P>

    “什么妇人？”</P>

    “您在孟费郿开过小酒店。”</P>

    “小酒店！从没有过的事。”</P>

    “我对您说，您是德纳第。”</P>

    “我否认。”</P>

    “还有，您是一个坏蛋，拿着。”</P>

    这时马吕斯从口袋里抽出一张钞票，摔在他脸上。</P>

    “谢谢！对不起！五百法郎！男爵先生！”</P>

    这人惊惶失措，鞠躬，抓住钞票，仔细瞧。</P>

    “五百法郎！”他惊讶地又说一遍。他含含糊糊地轻声说道：“值钱的钞票！”</P>

    于是突然又说：</P>

    “好吧，”他大声说，“让我们舒服一下吧。”</P>

    说后他用猴子般灵敏的速度，把头发朝后一甩，抓下眼镜，从鼻孔里取出那两根鸡毛管并把它们藏起来，这是刚才已提到的东西，并且在这本书的另一页上也已经见到过。他象脱帽那样改变了他的脸谱。</P>

    他的眼睛发亮了；一个凹凸不平、有的地方有着疙瘩的、皱得出奇的丑的额头露出来了，鼻子又恢复鹰钩形；这个诡谲凶狠的掠夺者的外形现在又出现了。</P>

    “男爵先生完全正确，”他用清晰的失去鼻音的声音说，“我是德纳第。”</P>

    他把驼背伸直了。</P>

    德纳第，确实是他，他非常吃惊，如果他能慌乱的话，他也会慌乱的。他是打算来使人大吃一惊的，结果是他自己吃了一惊。这种屈辱的代价是五百法郎，总之，他还是收下；但不免仍感到惊愕。</P>

    尽管他化了装，第一次来见这位彭眉胥男爵，这位彭眉胥男爵就认出了他，并且还彻底了解他。这男爵非但知道德纳第的事，同时似乎也知道冉阿让的事。这个基本上还没长胡子的青年是个什么人？他如此冷酷然而又如此慷慨，他知道别人的名字，知道别人所有的名字，慷慨解囊，但叱责骗子又象法官，赏他们钱时又象个受骗的傻瓜。</P>

    我们记得，德纳第虽曾是马吕斯的邻居，但却从没见过他，这在巴黎是常有的事；他曾隐隐约约听到他的女儿们提到过有个穷青年叫马吕斯，住在那幢房子里。他给他写过我们知道的那封信，但并不认识他。在他思想里还不可能把这个马吕斯和彭眉胥男爵先生联系起来。</P>

    至于彭眉胥的名字，我们记得在滑铁卢战场上，德纳第只听到最后两个音，他对这两个音①一直是蔑视的，人们看不起简单的一声道谢，这是合情合理的。 </P>

    ①“彭眉胥”（Pontmercy）后面两个音是“眉胥”，与法文中的“谢谢”（merci）发音相同。</P>

    此外，他让女儿阿兹玛跟踪二月十六日的新婚夫妇，依靠女儿，再靠自己的搜索，结果他得知很多情节，从他黑暗的深处，他抓住了不止一根秘密线索。他施展了不少伎俩后发现了，或至少在尽量归纳推理后，猜到他那天在大阴沟里遇到的是什么人。从这个人，很容易就得到了他的名字。他知道彭眉胥男爵夫人就是珂赛特。但关于这一点，他打算谨慎从事。珂赛特是谁？他自己也不很清楚。他模糊地预感到是个私生子，芳汀的历史他一直觉得是有点不明不白的，谈这些有什么用呢？为保守秘密而得些报酬吗？他有，或认为自己有比这更值钱的东西要出卖。还有，按照表面的情况看，没有证据就来向彭眉胥男爵泄露“您的夫人是个私生儿”，这样的结果会使告密者的腰部挨到丈夫的脚踢。</P>

    在德纳第看来，和马吕斯的谈话还没有开始。他不得不先退却，改变战略，放弃阵地，上另一道前线，主要之事尚未达成协议，他已有五百法郎在口袋里了。此外他还有一些有决定意义的东西要说，他觉得来对抗这个既无所不知又武装得那么好的彭眉胥男爵他仍是个强者。象德纳第这种性格的人，所有的对话都是在搏斗。在即将进行的这场搏斗中，自己的情况究竟如何？他不知道他说话的对象是谁，但他知道要说的内容是什么。他很快暗暗地检阅了一下自己的力量，在说过了“我是德纳第”之后，他等待着。</P>

    马吕斯在深思。他终于抓到了德纳第。这个人，他多么希望能找到他，现在就在身边了。他可以实践彭眉胥上校的叮嘱了。这位英雄欠了这个贼的情，他父亲从墓底开给他马吕斯的汇票至今没有兑现，他感到是种羞辱。面对德纳第时他思想里也有着复杂的想法，他感到应为上校不幸被这类坏蛋所救而复仇。但不管怎样，他是满意的。他终于要把上校的幽灵从这下流的债权人那里救出来，他感到他将把父亲身后的名誉从债务的牢狱中解救出来。</P>

    除了这一责任外，还有另外一点他也要搞清楚，如果他能办到的话，那就是珂赛特财产的来源问题。机会好象已在眼前，德纳第可能知道一些情况。深探这个人的底细可能有用处。他就从这里开始。</P>

    德纳第已把这“值钱的钞票”藏进了背心的口袋里，温和到接近柔情的程度望着马吕斯。</P>

    马吕斯打破了沉默：</P>

    “德纳第，我对您说出了您的名字。现在，您想告诉我的秘密，要不要我来向您说？我也有我的情报，我，您会觉察到我知道得比您更多。冉阿让，您说他是杀人犯和盗贼。他是盗贼，因为他抢劫了一个富有的手工业厂主马德兰先生，并使他破了产。他是个杀人犯，因为他杀死了警察沙威。”</P>

    “我不懂，男爵先生。”德纳第说。</P>

    “我把话说清楚，听着，大约在一八二二年时，在加来海峡省的一个区，有一个过去和司法机关有过纠葛的人，名叫马德兰先生，他后来改过自新，恢复了名誉。这人成为一个不折不扣的正直的人。他创建一种行业制造黑玻璃珠子，使得全城发了财。至于他自己也发了财，那是次要的，可以说是偶然的。他是穷人的救济者，他设立医院，开办学校，探望病人，给姑娘们钱作嫁妆，援助寡妇，抚育孤儿，他好象是地方上的一个保护人。他拒绝接受勋章，他被提名为市长。一个释放了的苦役犯知道这人过去被判过刑的隐情，揭发了这人并使他被捕，这个苦役犯又利用这人被捕来到巴黎，从拉菲特银行棗我这个情报是出纳员供给的棗，用一个假签名，领走了马德兰存款上五十万以上的法郎。这个抢劫了马德兰先生的苦役犯就是冉阿让，至于另一桩事，您也没有什么可告诉我的。冉阿让杀死了沙威，他用手枪打死的，我当时正在场。”</P>

    德纳第神气地向马吕斯看了一眼，就象一个吃败仗的人又抓住了胜利，并在一分钟内收回了所有失地，但他立刻又恢复了微笑，下级在上级前的得胜应该显得温和，德纳第只向马吕斯说：</P>

    “男爵先生，我们走岔道了。”</P>

    他为了要强调这句话，故意把一串饰物抡了一转。</P>

    “怎么！”马吕斯说，“您能驳倒这些吗？这是事实。”</P>

    “这是幻想。我荣幸地得到男爵先生的信任，使我有义务向他这样说，首先要注意事实和正义。我不愿见到有人不公正地控告别人。男爵先生，冉阿让并没有抢劫马德兰，还有冉阿让也没有杀死沙威。”</P>

    “这真叫人很难相信！为什么？”</P>

    “为了两个原因。”</P>

    “哪两个？说。”</P>

    “第一，他没有抢劫马德兰先生，因为冉阿让本人就是马德兰先生。”</P>

    “您说什么？”</P>

    “而第二，他没有杀死沙威，因为杀死沙威的人，就是沙威自己。”</P>

    “您这是什么意思？”</P>

    “我的意思是沙威是自杀的。”</P>

    “拿出证据来！拿出证明来！”马吕斯怒不可遏地叫着。</P>

    德纳第一字一句地重新说了一遍，好象在念十二音节的古诗。</P>

    “警察---沙威---被发现---溺死在---交易所桥的---一条船下。”</P>

    “拿出证据来。”</P>

    德纳第在旁边的口袋里取出一个灰色大信封，好象装有一些折成大小不等的纸。</P>

    “我有我的案卷。”他镇静地说。</P>

    他又补充道：</P>

    “男爵先生，为了您的利益，我曾深入了解我的冉阿让。我说冉阿让和马德兰就是一个人，我又说沙威除了沙威自己以外，没有别人杀死他，我这样说，我是有证据的。不是手写的证据，手写是可疑的，可以为献殷勤而随便乱写，我的证据是印刷品。”</P>

    德纳第一边说，一边从信封里取出两张发黄、陈旧、有一大股烟味的报纸。其中一张，折叠的边缘部分已破碎，成块地掉下来，看来比另一张更陈旧。</P>

    “两件事情，两种证据。”德纳第说。于是他把两张打开的报纸递给马吕斯。</P>

    这两张报纸读者都知道，最旧的那张是一八二三年七月二十五日的《白旗报》，我们可以在本书的第三卷第一四八页看到原文。证实了马德兰先生和冉阿让确是一个人；另一张是一八三二年六月十五日的《通报》，证明沙威的自杀，附加说明这是引自沙威向警署署长的口头汇报：当他被囚在麻厂街街垒时，一个宽宏大量的暴动者饶了他一命，那人持枪可以打死他，但却没有打他的脑袋而只向空中放了枪。</P>

    马吕斯读了，这是明显的事，日期确切，证据无可怀疑，这两张报纸不是为了证明德纳第的话而故意印刷出来的，在《通报》上刊登的消息又是警署官方提供的。马吕斯不能怀疑。那个出纳员提供的情况是假的，自己也搞错了。冉阿让，忽然变伟大了，从云雾中出来，马吕斯禁不住欢快地叫道：</P>

    “那么，这不幸的人是一个可敬可佩的人！这笔财产真是他的！他就是马德兰，整整一个地区的护卫者！冉阿让是沙威的救命人！这是个英雄！一个圣人！”</P>

 Part 5 Book 9 Chapter 5 A Night Behind Which There Is Day

    Jean Valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door. </P>

    "Come in," he said feebly. </P>

    The door opened. </P>

    Cosette and Marius made their appearance.</P>

    Cosette rushed into the room.</P>

    Marius remained on the threshold, leaning against the jamb of the door.</P>

    "Cosette!" said Jean Valjean.</P>

    And he sat erect in his chair, his arms outstretched and trembling, haggard, livid, gloomy, an immense joy in his eyes. </P>

    Cosette, stifling with emotion, fell upon Jean Valjean's breast.</P>

    "Father!" said she.</P>

    Jean Valjean, overcome, stammered:</P>

    "Cosette! She! You! Madame! It is thou! Ah! My God!"</P>

    And, pressed close in Cosette's arms, he exclaimed:</P>

    "It is thou! Thou art here! Thou dost pardon me then!"</P>

    Marius, lowering his eyelids, in order to keep his tears from flowing, took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted to repress his sobs:</P>

    "My father!"</P>

    "And you also, you pardon me!" Jean Valjean said to him.</P>

    Marius could find no words, and Jean Valjean added:</P>

    "Thanks."</P>

    Cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed.</P>

    "It embarrasses me," said she.</P>

    And, seating herself on the old man's knees, she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement, and kissed his brow. </P>

    Jean Valjean, bewildered, let her have her own way.</P>

    Cosette, who only understood in a very confused manner, redoubled her caresses, as though she desired to pay Marius' debt.</P>

    Jean Valjean stammered:</P>

    "How stupid people are! I thought that I should never see her again. Imagine, Monsieur Pontmercy, at the very moment when you entered, I was saying to myself:`All is over. Here is her little gown, I am a miserable man, I shall never see Cosette again,' and I was saying that at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs. Was not I an idiot? Just see how idiotic one can be! One reckons without the good God. The good God says: </P>

    "`You fancy that you are about to be abandoned, stupid! No. No, things will not go so. Come, there is a good man yonder who is in need of an angel.' And the angel comes, and one sees one's Cosette again! And one sees one's little Cosette once more! Ah! I was very unhappy."</P>

    For a moment he could not speak, then he went on:</P>

    "I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then. A heart needs a bone to gnaw. But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the way. I gave myself reasons: `they do not want you, keep in your own course, one has not the right to cling eternally.' Ah! God be praised, I see her once more! Dost thou know, Cosette, thy husband is very handsome? Ah! What a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on, luckily. I am fond of that pattern. It was thy husband who chose it, was it not? And then, thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls. Let me call her thou, Monsieur Pontmercy. It will not be for long." </P>

    And Cosette began again:</P>

    "How wicked of you to have left us like that! Where did you go? Why have you stayed away so long? Formerly your journeys only lasted three or four days. I sent Nicolette, the answer always was: He is absent.' How long have you been back? Why did you not let us know? Do you know that you are very much changed? Ah! What a naughty father! he has been ill, and we have not known it! Stay, Marius, feel how cold his hand is!" </P>

    "So you are here! Monsieur Pontmercy, you pardon me!" repeated Jean Valjean.</P>

    At that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more, all that was swelling Marius' heart found vent. </P>

    He burst forth:</P>

    "Cosette, do you hear? He has come to that! He asks my forgiveness! And do you know what he has done for me, Cosette? He has saved my life. He has done more--he has given you to me. And after having saved me, and after having given you to me, Cosette, what has he done with himself? He has sacrificed himself. Behold the man. And he says to me the ingrate, to me the forgetful, to me the pitiless, to me the guilty one: Thanks! Cosette, my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little.That barricade, that sewer, that furnace, that cesspool,--all that he traversed for me, for thee, Cosette! He carried me away through all the deaths which he put aside before me, and accepted for himself. Every courage, every virtue, every heroism, every sanctity he possesses! Cosette, that man is an angel!" </P>

    "Hush! Hush!" said Jean Valjean in a low voice. "Why tell all that?" </P>

    "But you!" cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration, "why did you not tell it to me? It is your own fault, too. You save people's lives, and you conceal it from them! You do more, under the pretext of unmasking yourself, you calumniate yourself. It is frightful."</P>

    "I told the truth," replied Jean Valjean.</P>

    "No," retorted Marius, "the truth is the whole truth; and that you did not tell. You were Monsieur Madeleine, why not have said so? You saved Javert, why not have said so? I owed my life to you, why not have said so?"</P>

    "Because I thought as you do. I thought that you were in the right. It was necessary that I should go away. If you had known about that affair, of the sewer, you would have made me remain near you. I was therefore forced to hold my peace. If I had spoken, it would have caused embarrassment in every way."</P>

    "It would have embarrassed what? Embarrassed whom?" retorted Marius. "Do you think that you are going to stay here? We shall carry you off. Ah! Good heavens! When I reflect that it was by an accident that I have learned all this. You form a part of ourselves. You are her father, and mine. You shall not pass another day in this dreadful house. Do not imagine that you will be here to-morrow." </P>

    "To-morrow," said Jean Valjean, "I shall not be here, but I shall not be with you."</P>

    "What do you mean?" replied Marius. "Ah! Come now, we are not going to permit any more journeys. You shall never leave us again. You belong to us. We shall not loose our hold of you." </P>

    "This time it is for good," added Cosette. "We have a carriage at the door. I shall run away with you. If necessary, I shall employ force."</P>

    And she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms.</P>

    "Your chamber still stands ready in our house," she went on. "If you only knew how pretty the garden is now! The azaleas are doing very well there. The walks are sanded with river sand; there are tiny violet shells. You shall eat my strawberries. I water them myself. And no more `madame,' no more `Monsieur Jean,' we are living under a Republic, everybody says thou, don't they, Marius? The programme is changed. If you only knew, father, I have had a sorrow, there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest in a hole in the wall, and a horrible cat ate her. My poor, pretty, little robin red-breast which used to put her head out of her window and look at me! I cried over it. I should have liked to kill the cat. But now nobody cries any more. Everybody laughs, everybody is happy. You are going to come with us. How delighted grandfather will be! You shall have your plot in the garden, you shall cultivate it, and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as mine. And, then, I shall do everything that you wish, and then, you will obey me prettily."</P>

    Jean Valjean listened to her without hearing her. He heard the music of her voice rather than the sense of her words; one of those large tears which are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes.</P>

    He murmured:</P>

    "The proof that God is good is that she is here."</P>

    "Father!" said Cosette.</P>

    Jean Valjean continued:</P>

    "It is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together. Their trees are full of birds. I would walk with Cosette. It is sweet to be among living people who bid each other `good-day,' who call to each other in the garden. People see each other from early morning. We should each cultivate our own little corner. She would make me eat her strawberries. I would make her gather my roses. That would be charming. Only . . ." </P>

    He paused and said gently:</P>

    "It is a pity."</P>

    The tear did not fall, it retreated, and Jean Valjean replaced it with a smile.</P>

    Cosette took both the old man's hands in hers.</P>

    "My God!" said she, "your hands are still colder than before. Are you ill? Do you suffer?"</P>

    "I? No," replied Jean Valjean. "I am very well. Only . . ."</P>

    He paused.</P>

    "Only what?"</P>

    "I am going to die presently."</P>

    Cosette and Marius shuddered.</P>

    "To die!" exclaimed Marius.</P>

    "Yes, but that is nothing," said Jean Valjean.</P>

    He took breath, smiled and resumed:</P>

    "Cosette, thou wert talking to me, go on, so thy little robin red-breast is dead? Speak, so that I may hear thy voice." </P>

    Marius gazed at the old man in amazement.</P>

    Cosette uttered a heartrending cry.</P>

    "Father! My father! you will live. You are going to live. I insist upon your living, do you hear?"</P>

    Jean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration.</P>

    "Oh! Yes, forbid me to die. Who knows? Perhaps I shall obey. I was on the verge of dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me that I was born again."</P>

    "You are full of strength and life," cried Marius. "Do you imagine that a person can die like this? You have had sorrow, you shall have no more. It is I who ask your forgiveness, and on my knees! You are going to live, and to live with us, and to live a long time. We take possession of you once more. There are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness."</P>

    "You see," resumed Cosette, all bathed in tears, "that Marius says that you shall not die." </P>

    Jean Valjean continued to smile.</P>

    "Even if you were to take possession of me, Monsieur Pontmercy, would that make me other than I am? No, God has thought like you and myself, and he does not change his mind; it is useful for me to go. Death is a good arrangement. God knows better than we what we need. May you be happy, may Monsieur Pontmercy have Cosette, may youth wed the morning, may there be around you, my children, lilacs and nightingales; may your life be a beautiful, sunny lawn, may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls, and now let me, who am good for nothing, die; it is certain that all this is right. Come, be reasonable, nothing is possible now, I am fully conscious that all is over. And then, last night, I drank that whole jug of water. How good thy husband is, Cosette! Thou art much better off with him than with me."</P>

    A noise became audible at the door.</P>

    It was the doctor entering.</P>

    "Good-day, and farewell, doctor," said Jean Valjean. "Here are my poor children."</P>

    Marius stepped up to the doctor. He addressed to him only this single word: "Monsieur? . . ." But his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question.</P>

    The doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance.</P>

    "Because things are not agreeable," said Jean Valjean, "that is no reason for being unjust towards God." </P>

    A silence ensued.</P>

    All breasts were oppressed.</P>

    Jean Valjean turned to Cosette. He began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity. </P>

    In the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended, ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at Cosette. The reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage. </P>

    The doctor felt of his pulse.</P>

    "Ah! it was you that he wanted!" he murmured, looking at Cosette and Marius.</P>

    And bending down to Marius' ear, he added in a very low voice:</P>

    "Too late."</P>

    Jean Valjean surveyed the doctor and Marius serenely, almost without ceasing to gaze at Cosette. </P>

    These barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth:</P>

    "It is nothing to die; it is dreadful not to live."</P>

    All at once he rose to his feet. These accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony. He walked with a firm step to the wall, thrusting aside Marius and the doctor who tried to help him, detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there, and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health, and said in a loud voice, as he laid the crucifix on the table:</P>

    "Behold the great martyr."</P>

    Then his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him.</P>

    His hands, which rested on his knees, began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers.</P>

    Cosette supported his shoulders, and sobbed, and tried to speak to him, but could not. </P>

    Among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears, they distinguished words like the following: </P>

    "Father, do not leave us. Is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again?" </P>

    It might be said that agony writhes. It goes, comes, advances towards the sepulchre, and returns towards life. There is groping in the action of dying.</P>

    Jean Valjean rallied after this semi-swoon, shook his brow as though to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid once more.</P>

    He took a fold of Cosette's sleeve and kissed it.</P>

    "He is coming back! doctor, he is coming back," cried Marius.</P>

    "You are good, both of you," said Jean Valjean. "I am going to tell you what has caused me pain. What has pained me, Monsieur Pontmercy, is that you have not been willing to touch that money. That money really belongs to your wife. I will explain to you, my children, and for that reason, also, I am glad to see you. Black jet comes from England, white jet comes from Norway. All this is in this paper, which you will read. For bracelets, I invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet iron, slides of iron laid together.It is prettier, better and less costly. You will understand how much money can be made in that way. So Cosette's fortune is really hers. I give you these details, in order that your mind may be set at rest."</P>

    The portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half-open door. The doctor dismissed her. </P>

    But he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared: "Would you like a priest?" </P>

    "I have had one," replied Jean Valjean.</P>

    And with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw some one. </P>

    It is probable, in fact, that the Bishop was present at this death agony.</P>

    Cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins.</P>

    Jean Valjean resumed:</P>

    "Have no fear, Monsieur Pontmercy, I adjure you. The six hundred thousand francs really belong to Cosette. My life will have been wasted if you do not enjoy them! We managed to do very well with those glass goods. We rivalled what is called Berlin jewellery. However, we could not equal the black glass of England. A gross, which contains twelve hundred very well cut grains, only costs three francs."</P>

    When a being who is dear to us is on the point of death, we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back.</P>

    Cosette gave her hand to Marius, and both, mute with anguish, not knowing what to say to the dying man, stood trembling and despairing before him.</P>

    Jean Valjean sank moment by moment. He was failing; he was drawing near to the gloomy horizon.</P>

    His breath had become intermittent; a little rattling interrupted it. He found some difficulty in moving his forearm, his feet had lost all movement, and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased, all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread over his brow. The light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes. </P>

    His face paled and smiled. Life was no longer there, it was something else.</P>

    His breath sank, his glance grew grander. He was a corpse on which the wings could be felt.</P>

    He made a sign to Cosette to draw near, then to Marius; the last minute of the last hour had, evidently, arrived. </P>

    He began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance, and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him.</P>

    "Draw near, draw near, both of you. I love you dearly. Oh! How good it is to die like this! And thou lovest me also, my Cosette. I knew well that thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man. How kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins! Thou wilt weep for me a little, wilt thou not? Not too much. I do not wish thee to have any real griefs. You must enjoy yourselves a great deal, my children. I forgot to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest. A gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty. It really was a good business. So there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs, Monsieur Pontmercy.It is honest money.You may be rich with a tranquil mind. Thou must have a carriage, a box at the theatres now and then, and handsome ball dresses, my Cosette, and then, thou must give good dinners to thy friends, and be very happy. I was writing to Cosette a while ago. She will find my letter. I bequeath to her the two candlesticks which stand on the chimney-piece. They are of silver, but to me they are gold, they are diamonds; they change candles which are placed in them into wax-tapers. I do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high. I have done what I could. My children, you will not forget that I am a poor man, you will have me buried in the first plot of earth that you find, under a stone to mark the spot. This is my wish. No name on the stone. If Cosette cares to come for a little while now and then, it will give me pleasure. And you too, Monsieur Pontmercy. I must admit that I have not always loved you. I ask your pardon for that. Now she and you form but one for me. I feel very grateful to you. I am sure that you make Cosette happy. If you only knew, Monsieur Pontmercy, her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight; when I saw her in the least pale, I was sad. In the chest of drawers, there is a bank-bill for five hundred francs. I have not touched it. It is for the poor. Cosette, dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed? dost thou recognize it? That was ten years ago, however. How time flies! We have been very happy. All is over. Do not weep, my children, I am not going very far, I shall see you from there, you will only have to look at night, and you will see me smile. Cosette, dost thou remember Montfermeil? Thou wert in the forest, thou wert greatly terrified; dost thou remember how I took hold of the handle of the water-bucket? That was the first time that I touched thy poor, little hand. It was so cold! Ah! Your hands were red then, mademoiselle, they are very white now. And the big doll! dost thou remember? Thou didst call her Catherine. Thou regrettedest not having taken her to the convent! How thou didst make me laugh sometimes, my sweet angel! When it had been raining, thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters, and watch them pass away. One day I gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow, blue and green feathers. Thou hast forgotten it. Thou wert roguish so young! Thou didst play. Thou didst put cherries in thy ears. Those are things of the past. The forests through which one has passed with one's child, the trees under which one has strolled, the convents where one has concealed oneself, the games, the hearty laughs of childhood, are shadows. I imagined that all that belonged to me. In that lay my stupidity. Those Thenardiers were wicked. Thou must forgive them. Cosette, the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother. She was called Fantine. Remember that name--Fantine. Kneel whenever thou utterest it. She suffered much. She loved thee dearly. She had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness. That is the way God apportions things. He is there on high, he sees us all, and he knows what he does in the midst of his great stars. I am on the verge of departure, my children. Love each other well and always. There is nothing else but that in the world: love for each other. You will think sometimes of the poor old man who died here. Oh my Cosette, it is not my fault, indeed, that I have not seen thee all this time, it cut me to the heart; I went as far as the corner of the street, I must have produced a queer effect on the people who saw me pass, I was like a madman, I once went out without my hat. I no longer see clearly, my children, I had still other things to say, but never mind. Think a little of me. Come still nearer. I die happy. Give me your dear and well-beloved heads, so that I may lay my hands upon them."</P>

    Cosette and Marius fell on their knees, in despair, suffocating with tears, each beneath one of Jean Valjean's hands. Those august hands no longer moved.</P>

    He had fallen backwards, the light of the candles illuminated him. </P>

    His white face looked up to heaven, he allowed Cosette and Marius to cover his hands with kisses.</P>

    He was dead.</P>

    The night was starless and extremely dark. No doubt, in the gloom,</P>

    some immense angel stood erect with wings outspread, awaiting that soul.</P>

    冉阿让听见敲门声，就转过身去。</P>

    “进来。”他用微弱的声音说。</P>

    门一开，珂赛特和马吕斯出现了。</P>

    珂赛特跑进房间。</P>

    马吕斯在门口站着，靠在门框上。</P>

    “珂赛特！”冉阿让说，他在椅子上竖起身来，张开颤抖的两臂，神情惊恐，面色惨白，看起来很骇人，目光里显出无限欢快。</P>

    珂赛特因激动而感到窒息，倒在冉阿让的怀中。</P>

    “父亲！”她喊着。</P>

    冉阿让精神错乱，结结巴巴地说：</P>

    “珂赛特！她！是您！夫人！啊！我的上帝！”</P>

    于是，在珂赛特的紧抱之中，他叫道：</P>

    “是你呀！你在这儿！你原谅我了！”</P>

    马吕斯垂着眼帘不让眼泪淌下，走近一步，嘴唇痉挛地紧缩着，忍住痛哭，轻轻地喊了一声：</P>

    “我的父亲！”</P>

    “您也是呀，您也原谅我了！”冉阿让说。</P>

    马吕斯一句话也说不出，冉阿让又说：“谢谢。”</P>

    珂赛特把围巾拉下来，把帽子扔在床上。</P>

    “戴着不方便。”她说。</P>

    她于是坐在老人的膝上，一边用可爱的动作把他的白发撂开，吻他的额头。</P>

    冉阿让随她摆布，神情恍惚。</P>

    珂赛特模糊地懂得了一点，她加倍亲热，好象要替马吕斯赎罪。</P>

    冉阿让含糊地说：</P>

    “我真傻！我以为见不到她了。您想想，彭眉胥先生，你们进来的时候，我正在想：‘完了，她的小裙衫在这儿，我是一个悲惨的人，我见不到珂赛特了。”我这样想时，你们正在上楼梯。我多愚蠢呀！蠢到如此地步！我们考虑问题没有想到上帝。慈悲的上帝说：‘你以为他们就这样把你遗弃了，傻瓜！不会的，不会，决不会这样的。来吧，这里有个可怜人需要一个天使。’天使就来了，我又见到了我的珂赛特，我又见到了我的小珂赛特！啊！我曾经万分痛苦呀！”</P>

    他有一阵子几乎说不出话来，后来又继续说下去：</P>

    “我实在十分需要偶尔来看看珂赛特。一颗心，需要一点寄托。但我又感到我是个多余的人。我自己说服自己：‘他们不需要你了，待在你自己的角落里吧，你无权永远赖着不走。’啊！感谢上帝，我又见到她了！你知道吗，珂赛特，你的丈夫很漂亮？啊！你有一个美丽的绣花领子，这样好得很。我爱这种花样。是你丈夫选择的，对吗？还有，你应当有几条开司米围巾，彭眉胥先生，让我称她‘你’吧。这不会很久了。”</P>

    珂赛特接着说：</P>

    “您这样把我们丢下多不近人情！您上哪儿去啦？为什么离开这么久？以前您多次的旅行最多三四天。我差妮珂莱特来，老回答说：‘他没有回来。’您什么时候回来的？为什么不告诉我们？您变化很大，您知道吗？啊！坏父亲！他生了病，我们竟不知道！你瞧，马吕斯，摸摸他的手，竟然冷成这个样！”</P>

    “这么说您来了！彭眉胥先生，您原谅我了。”冉阿让又说了一遍。</P>

    听了冉阿让重复这句话，一切拥塞在马吕斯心头的东西找到了发泄的机会，爆发出来了：</P>

    “珂赛特，你听见吗？他还这样说！要我原谅他。你知道他怎样对待我吗，珂赛特？他救了我的命。他做的还不止这些，他把你给了我。在救了我之后，在把你给了我之后，珂赛特，他自己又怎么样呢？他牺牲了自己。他就是这样一个人。而对我这忘恩负义的人，对我这个健忘的人，对我这个残酷的人，对我这个罪人，他却说：‘谢谢！’珂赛特，我一辈子为他鞠躬尽瘁也不能报答他。这个街垒，这条阴沟，这个火坑，这些污水沟，他都经历过了，为了我，为了你，珂赛特！他背着我，使我避开一切死难，而他自己却承受一切。一切勇敢，一切道义，一切英雄精神，一切神圣的品德，他都具备了！珂赛特，这个人真是一位天使！”</P>

    “嘘！嘘！”冉阿让轻声说，“为什么要说这些话？”</P>

    “但是您！”马吕斯生气然而又尊敬地说，“为什么您不说这些事？这也是您的过错，您救了别人的命，还要瞒着别人！尤其是，借口说您要暴露自己，您其实是在诽谤自己，这真可怕。”</P>

    “我说的是真话。”冉阿让回答。</P>

    “没有，”马吕斯又说，“讲真话，要讲全部的真话，而您并没有讲。您是马德兰先生，为什么没有讲？您救了沙威，为什么不讲？您救了我的命，为什么不讲？”</P>

    “因为我想的和您一样，我觉得您有道理。我应该走开。如果您知道了阴沟的事，您就要留我在你们身边。因此我不应该说。如果我说出来，大家都会感到拘束了。”</P>

    “拘束什么！谁拘束呢！”马吕斯回答。“难道您还想待在这儿吗？我们要带您走。啊！天哪！我想到我完全是偶然获悉这些情况的！我们要把您接去，您和我们是分不开的。您是她的父亲，也是我的。您不会再多留一天在这可怕的屋子里了。您不要以为您明天还在这儿。”</P>

    “明天，”冉阿让说，“我不会在这儿，但也不会在您的家里。”</P>

    “您这是什么意思？”马吕斯问，“啊，现在我们不允许您再去旅行。您不要再离开我们，您是我们的人，我们不放您走了。”</P>

    “这一次，说了是要算数的。”珂赛特加上一句。“我们有车子在下面，我们要把您带走，如果有必要的话，我还要用武力呢！”</P>

    于是她笑着做出用手臂抱起老人的姿势。</P>

    “家里一直保留着您住的房间，”她继续说，“您可知道现在花园可真美呀！杜鹃花开得很茂盛。小路都用河沙铺过了，沙里还有小的紫色贝壳。您将要吃到我的草莓，是我自己浇水种的。没有什么夫人，也没有什么让先生了，我们都生活在共和国里，大家都以‘你’相称。对吗？马吕斯？生活的法则也变了。您不知道，父亲，我有一件伤心事，有一只知更鸟在墙头洞里做了窝，一只可恶的猫把它吃掉了。我那可怜的美丽的小知更鸟把头伸在它的窗口望着我！我曾为它哭泣，我真想杀了那只猫！但现在没有人哭了。大家都欢笑，大家都幸福。您和我们一起回去。外祖父会多么高兴呀！在花园里您将要有您的一小块地，您自己耕种，我们看看您的草莓是不是和我的长得一样好。还有，我样样依顺您，还有，您得好好地听我的话。”</P>

    冉阿让在听着，但又没听见，他听着她那象音乐一样的说话声，而不是听懂她话的意思；一大颗眼泪，灵魂里幽暗的珍珠，慢慢地在眼里出现，于是他轻声说：</P>

    “足以证明上帝是慈悲的，她在这儿了。”</P>

    “父亲！”珂赛特呼唤着。</P>

    冉阿让继续说：</P>

    “不错，能在一起生活，这多好。树上有很多鸟。我和珂赛特去散步，和活着的人一样，互相问好，在花园里相互呼唤，这多甜蜜。从清早就能相见。我们每人各种一块地。她种的草莓给我吃，我让她摘我的玫瑰花，这该多么好呀。但是……”</P>

    他停下来温和地说：</P>

    “可惜。”</P>

    眼泪没落下来，又收回去了，冉阿让用一个微笑代替了它。</P>

    珂赛特把老人的双手握在她手中。</P>

    “我的上帝！”她说，“您的手更冷了。您有病吗？您不舒服吗？”</P>

    “我吗，没有病，”冉阿让回答说，“我很舒服，可是……”</P>

    他又停下不说了。</P>

    “可是怎么样呢？”</P>

    “我马上就要死了。”</P>

    珂赛特和马吕斯听了以后就打颤。</P>

    “要死了！”马吕斯叫道。</P>

    “是呀，但这不算什么。”冉阿让说。</P>

    他呼吸了一下，微笑着，又说了下去：</P>

    “珂赛特，你刚才在和我说话，继续下去，再说点，那么说你的小知更鸟是死了，讲吧，让我听听你的声音！”</P>

    马吕斯吓呆了，他望着老人。</P>

    珂赛特发出一声凄厉的叫声。</P>

    “父亲！我的父亲！您要活下去，您会活的，我要您活下去，听见了吧！”</P>

    冉阿让抬起头来向着她，带着一种热爱的神色：“噢，是的，禁止我死吧。谁知道？我可能会听从的。你们来时我正要死去，就这样我就停了下来，我觉得我好象又活过来了。”</P>

    “您是充满了活力和生命的，”马吕斯大声说，“难道您认为一个人会这样死去吗？您曾痛苦过，以后再不会有了。是我在请求您的原谅，我还要跪着请求您的原谅！您会活着的，和我们一起活着，并且还会长寿。我们接您回去。我们两人从今以后只有一个愿望，那就是您的幸福！”</P>

    “您看，”珂赛特满面泪痕地说，“马吕斯说您不会死的。”</P>

    冉阿让微笑着继续说：</P>

    “彭眉胥先生，您带我回去，难道我就不会是现在的我了吗？不行，上帝的想法和您我一样，并且他不会改变主张，我最好还是离开。死是一种妥善的安排。上帝比我们更知道我们需要的是什么。祝你们快乐，祝彭眉胥先生有着珂赛特，青春要和清晨作伴，我的孩子们，你们四周有丁香，又有黄莺，你们的生命象朝阳下美丽的草坪，天上的喜悦充满你们的心灵，现在我已一无用处，让我死吧，肯定这一切都会好的。你们看，要懂道理，现在一切都已经不能挽救了，我觉得自己是绝对完了。一个钟头以前，我昏厥了一次。还有昨天晚上，我喝完了这一罐水。你的丈夫真好，珂赛特！你跟着他比跟着我好多了。”</P>

    门上发出声音。是医生进来了。</P>

    “早安和再见，医生，”冉阿让说，“这是我可怜的孩子们。”马吕斯走近医生，他只向他说了两个字：“先生？……”但说时的神情等于完整地提了一个问题。</P>

    医生向他丢了一个有表情的眼色作回答。</P>

    “因为这种事使人感到不愉快，”冉阿让说，“这不能成为自己对上帝不公正的一种借口。”</P>

    大家静默无言，所有人的心都感到沉重。</P>

    冉阿让转向珂赛特，向她凝视着，好象要把她的形象带到永生里去那样。他虽已沉入黑暗深处，但望着珂赛特他还会出神。这个温柔的容貌使他苍白的脸发出光芒，墓窟因而也有着它的光彩。</P>

    医生为他诊脉。</P>

    “啊！原来他缺少的是你们。”他望着珂赛特和马吕斯轻声说。</P>

    于是他凑近马吕斯的耳边轻声加了一句：</P>

    “太迟了。”</P>

    冉阿让几乎不停地望着珂赛特，安静地看看马吕斯和医生。我们听见从他嘴里含糊地说出这样的一句话：</P>

    “死不算一回事，可怕的是不能活了。”</P>

    忽然他站起身来，这种体力的恢复有时就是临终的挣扎。他稳稳地走向墙壁，把要扶他的马吕斯和医生推开，取下挂在墙上的铜十字架，回来坐下的动作好象完全健康时那样自由自在，他把十字架放在桌上并且高声说：</P>

    “这就是伟大的殉道者。”</P>

    然后他的胸部下陷，头摇晃了一下，好象墓中的沉醉侵占了他，放在膝上的两只手开始用手指甲抠裤子的布。</P>

    珂赛特扶着他的双肩呜咽着，想要和他说话又说不出来。我们听见她含着凄惶的口水伴着眼泪这样说：“父亲，不要离开我们，怎么能刚找到您就失去您呢？”</P>

    我们可以说垂死的挣扎有如蛇行，它去了又来，走近坟墓而又回头走向生命，在死亡的动作里有着摸索的过程。</P>

    冉阿让在半昏迷状态之后，又恢复了一点气力，他摇晃了一下脑袋，象要甩掉黑暗，接着几乎变得完全清醒了。他拿起珂赛特的一角袖子吻了一下。</P>

    “他缓过来了！医生，他缓过来了！”马吕斯喊着。</P>

    “你们两个人都好，”冉阿让说，“我告诉你们什么事在使我痛苦。使我痛苦的是，彭眉胥先生，您不肯动用那笔款。那笔款确是您夫人的。我要向你们解释，我的孩子们，也就是为了这个原因，我很高兴见到你们。黑玉是英国的产品，白玉是挪威的产品。这一切都写在这张纸上，你们以后看吧。关于手镯，我发明了不用焊药焊住金属扣环，而是把金属扣环搭紧，这样比较美观，而且价廉物美。你们明白这样可以赚很多钱。因此珂赛特的财产确是属于她的。我讲这些详情为了使你们安心。”</P>

    看门的上楼来了，通过半开的门向里面探望着，医生叫她走开，但没能制止这个热心的妇人在走开之前向垂死的人大声说：</P>

    “您需要一个神父吗？”</P>

    “我已有了一个。”冉阿让回答。</P>

    这时他用手指好象指着他头上方的某一处，他好象看见有个人。</P>

    大概主教真的在这临终的时刻来到了。</P>

    珂赛特轻手轻脚地把一个枕头塞在他的腰部。</P>

    冉阿让又说：</P>

    “彭眉胥先生，不用担心，我恳求您。那六十万法郎是属于珂赛特的。如果你们不愿享受它，那我就白活了！我们很成功地做出了这些玻璃饰物。我们和被称作柏林的首饰竞争，可是比不上德国的黑玻璃。一罗有一千二百粒打磨得整齐的珠子只要三个法郎。”</P>

    当我们所爱的一个人要临终时，我们的眼睛就盯住他，想把他留住。他们两人痛苦得说不出话来，不知要向垂死的人说些什么，他们失望地颤抖着站在他眼前，马吕斯握着珂赛特的手。</P>

    冉阿让一点一点地衰竭下去，他不断地在变弱，他已接近黑暗的天边。他的呼吸已断断续续；喉中有种嘎嘎的响声在间歇地截断气息，他的上臂已很难移动，足部也已经不能动，当四肢失灵，身体越来越衰竭时，庄严的灵魂在上升，并且已经显示在他的额头上。他的眼珠里已经出现了未知世界的光明。</P>

    他的脸逐渐失色，但仍带着笑容，生命已经结束，有的是其他的东西。他的呼吸中断，眼睛睁大，人们觉得这是一具长着翅膀的尸体。</P>

    他做了一个手势要珂赛特走近，又要马吕斯走近；这肯定是最后一小时的最后一分钟，他用微弱得好象来自远方的声音和他们说话，现在好象已有一堵墙把他和他们隔开了。</P>

    “过来，你俩过来，我很爱你们，啊！这样死去有多好！你也一样，你爱我，我的珂赛特。我知道你对你这个老人一直是有感情的，你把这靠垫放在我腰部是多么体贴我！你将会稍稍为我哭一下，对不对？可不要太过分。我不愿你真的难过。你们应当多多享乐，我的孩子。我还忘了告诉你们，没有扣针的扣环比所有的一切更赚钱。十二打的成本只合十个法郎，卖出去是六十法郎。这真是一个好买卖。所以您不要再为会有六十万法郎而感到诧异了，彭眉胥先生。这是清白的钱，你们可以安享富贵。应该有一辆车，不时定一个包厢到戏院去看看戏，做些漂亮的舞会服装，我的珂赛特，用盛宴招待你们的朋友，要生活得非常幸福。刚才我写了封信给珂赛特。她会找到我的信的。我把壁炉上这对烛台留给她。烛台是银的，但对我来说它是金的，是钻石的，它能把插在上面的蜡烛变成神烛。我不知道把它赠给我的那一位在天上是否对我感到满意，我已尽我所能了。孩子们，你们不要忘了我是一个穷苦人，你们把我埋在随便哪一块地上，用一块石板盖着做记号。这是我的遗愿。石上不要刻名字。如果珂赛特有时能来看望我一下，我会感到愉快。还有您也来，彭眉胥先生。我要向您承认，我并非一直都对您有好感的，我为此向您道歉。现在您和她，对我来说是一个人了。我十分感激您，我感到您使珂赛特幸福。您可知道，彭眉胥先生，她那红润而美丽的双颊就是我的愉快，当我看见她有点憔悴时，我便心里发愁。在橱柜里有一张五百法郎的票子。我还没有动用。这是施舍给穷人的。珂赛特，你看见你的小裙衫在这张床上吗？你还认得吗？其实这还只是十年前的事。时间过得多么快呀！我们曾经多么幸福呀。现在完了。孩子们不要哭，我去不了多远。我从那儿看得见你们。当天黑下来的时候，你们只要注意瞧，会望见我在微笑。珂赛特，你还记得在孟费郿，在树林里，你多么害怕，你还记得当时我提起水桶把吗？那是第一次我接触到你这可怜的小手，它是冰凉的！啊！当时你的手冻得通红，小姐，现在你的手是雪白的了。还有你的大娃娃！你记得吗？你叫她卡特琳。你后悔没有把她带进修女院！有时你真令我发笑，我可爱的天使！下雨的时候，你把草茎放在水沟里看着它们漂去。有一天，我买了一个柳条拍子和一个黄蓝绿三色的羽毛球给你。你忘了这些事了。你小时候多调皮！你玩着。你把樱桃放在耳朵里。这些都是过去的事了。我和我的孩子经过的森林，我们一起在下面散步的树木，我们一起藏身的修女院，种种游戏，童年时代欢畅的嬉笑，都已经消失了。我一直认为这一切是属于我的，我愚蠢之处就在于此。德纳第家的人都很凶狠，原谅他们吧。珂赛特，现在我该把你母亲的名字告诉你了。她叫芳汀。记住这个名字：芳汀。当你提到她的名字时，你应当跪下。她吃过很多苦。她非常爱你，她的痛苦正和你的幸福成对比。这是上帝的安排。他在天上，他看见我们大家，他在他的星宿中知道他做的一切。我就要去了，孩子们，你们永远相爱吧。世上除了相爱之外几乎没有别的了。你们有时想想死在这儿的可怜的老人。啊！我的珂赛特，这些时候我没有见到你，这可不怪我，那时我心都碎了；我一直走到你住的那条街的拐角上，见到我走过的人一定觉得我古怪，我好象疯了一样，有一次我没有戴帽子就出去了。孩子们，我现在已看不大清楚了，我还有话要说，算了吧。你们稍稍地想一想我。你们是上帝保佑的人。我不知道我怎么啦，我看见光亮。你们俩再挨近我些，我愉快地死去。把你们亲爱的头挨近我，我好把手放上去。”</P>

    珂赛特和马吕斯跪下，心慌意乱，悲泪哽咽，每人靠着冉阿让的一只手，这只庄严的手已不再动弹了。</P>

    他倒向后面，两支烛光照着他；他那白色的脸望着上天，他让珂赛特和马吕斯拼命吻他的手，他死了。</P>

    夜没有星光，一片漆黑，在黑暗中，可能有一个站着的大天使展开着双翅，在等待着这个灵魂。</P>

 Part 5 Book 9 Chapter 6 The Grass Covers and the Rain Effaces

    In the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise, in the vicinity of the common grave, far from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres, far from all the tombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all the hideous fashions of death, in a deserted corner, beside an old wall, beneath a great yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus, amid dandelions and mosses, there lies a stone. That stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy of time, of dampness, of the lichens and from the defilement of the birds. The water turns it green, the air blackens it. It is not near any path, and people are not fond of walking in that direction, because the grass is high and their feet are immediately wet. When there is a little sunshine, the lizards come thither. All around there is a quivering of weeds. In the spring, linnets warble in the trees.</P>

    This stone is perfectly plain. In cutting it the only thought was the requirements of the tomb, and no other care was taken than to make the stone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man.</P>

    No name is to be read there.</P>

    Only, many years ago, a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines, which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust, and which are, to-day, probably effaced: </P>

    Il dort. Quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange, Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange. La chose simplement d'elle-meme arriva, Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s'en va.[70]</P>

    [70] He sleeps. Although his fate was very strange, he lived. He died when he had no longer his angel. The thing came to pass simply, of itself, as the night comes when day is gone. </P>

    在拉雪兹神甫公墓里，靠近普通墓穴的旁边，远离这墓园中幽雅的地区，远离那些希奇古怪的在永恒面前还要展示死后时兴式样的丑墓，就在一个荒僻的角落里，靠着一堵旧墙，在一棵爬着牵牛花的大水杉下面，在茅草和青苔之中，有一块石板，这块石板和别的石板一样，日子一久也剥落得斑斑点点，发了霉，长着苔藓，堆着鸟粪。雨水使它发绿，空气使它变黑。它不在任何路旁，人们不爱到这边来，因为野草太高，使脚立刻浸湿。当少许太阳露面时，壁虎会出现，四周还有野燕麦围着沙沙作响，春天红雀在树上欢唱。</P>

    这块石板是光秃秃的，凿石的人只想到这是筑墓石所需，除了使它够长够宽能盖住一个人之外，就没有考虑过其他方面。</P>

    上面没有名字。</P>

    但是多年前，有只手用铅笔在上面写了四句诗，在雨露和尘土的洗刷下已慢慢地看不清楚了，而今天大概已经消失了：</P>

    他安息了。尽管命运多舛，</P>

    他仍偷生。失去了他的天使他就丧生；</P>

    事情是自然而然地发生，</P>
